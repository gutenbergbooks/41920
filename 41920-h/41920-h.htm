<h5 class="lg150">PREFACE.</h5>

  <p>In the present and previous series of "The Moths of the British
  Isles," over 750 species have been portrayed on the plates and described
  in the text&mdash;a number that includes all those insects formerly
  grouped under the now obsolete term "Macro-Lepidoptera." The task of
  dealing with so many species in two volumes has necessarily imposed
  brevity in their treatment; but it is hoped that nothing has been omitted
  that could be legitimately regarded as falling within the scope of
  volumes especially designed for the votaries of Nature Study.</p>

  <p>To have comprised in this scheme the large contingent of our moths
  known as "Micro-Lepidoptera" would have reduced further the space
  available for those species which experience shows appeal to the majority
  of nature students in a way that the minuter forms may not do. Even then,
  only a few general remarks on each group would have been possible, with,
  perhaps, a portrait or two of representative species. Such a course
  seemed hardly likely to prove of practical utility. The "Small Fry," as
  they have been called, exceedingly interesting though they may be to a
  limited number of students, have therefore been left for separate
  treatment at some more convenient season.</p>

  <p>Both classification and nomenclature are always under revision, and we
  are probably a long way from hearing the last word concerning either.
  These are, however, matters that <!-- Page vi --><span class="pagenum" title="010.png"
  ><a name="pagevi"></a>{vi}</span>cannot be ignored even in a popular
  work; consequently I have ventured to adopt sundry changes in arrangement
  and in names which, although not departing from the old style in any very
  large way, still approach pretty closely to the new.</p>

  <p>I have again to tender my sincere thanks to Mr. Robert Adkin, F.E.S.,
  for kindly lending specimens of rare species and varieties for figuring;
  and also to Mr. B. Adkin, Mr. G. T. Porritt, F.E.S., and Mr. A. J.
  Scollick, F.E.S. I desire also to gratefully acknowledge the loan of
  further beautiful coloured drawings by Mr. Alfred Sich, F.E.S. These
  figures have been most accurately reproduced in black and white by Mr.
  Horace Knight, to whom I am greatly indebted for his able assistance in
  connection with the numerous drawings of ova, larvæ, and pupæ. In some
  cases the preserved skin of a caterpillar had to serve as a model, and
  where this occurs the fact is mentioned. A few figures of larvæ have been
  copied from Dr. G. Hofmann's <i>Die Raupen der Schmetterlinge
  Europas</i>, 2nd edit., by Professor Dr. Arnold Spuler. All such
  reproductions are duly noted in the text.</p>

  <p>Mr. Knight is also responsible for the coloured drawings for Plates <a
  href="#plate1">1</a>, <a href="#plate13">13</a>, <a
  href="#plate36">36</a>, <a href="#plate61">61</a>, <a

  href="#plate100">100</a>, <a href="#plate104">104</a>, <a
  href="#plate134">134</a>, and <a href="#plate148">148</a>; the figures on
  which, except that of <i>Zygæna filipendulæ ab. chrysanthemi</i>, are
  from specimens.</p>

  <p>"A Forester," Mr. H. Main, F.E.S., and Mr. W. J. Lucas, B.A., F.E.S.,
  were good enough to furnish prints of some of their excellent photographs
  depicting life-history details of moths and caterpillars in repose, as
  met with in nature.</p>

<h5 class="lg200">THE MOTHS OF THE BRITISH ISLES.</h5>

<h5 class="lg150">NOCTUIDÆ.</h5>

<h5 class="lg125">TRIFINÆ (<i>continued</i>).</h5>

<h5><b>The Heart Moth</b> (<i>Dicycla oo</i>).</h5>

  <p>A male specimen of the ordinary form of this moth is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate2">2</a>, Fig. 1. Ab. <i>renago</i>, Haworth has the space
  between the central shade and the submarginal line more or less suffused
  with dusky or reddish grey. An intermediate form (Fig. 2) has a
  transverse band of darker colour between the second and submarginal lines
  of the fore wings (ab. <i>ferruginago</i>, Hübn.). The ground colour
  varies from a whitish or straw-yellow to reddish yellow (ab.
  <i>rufescens</i>, Tutt), and the markings are more distinct in some
  specimens than in others.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds from April to early June on the foliage
  of the oak, is black above and brownish beneath; there are three white
  lines on the back, the central one widest and more or less interrupted;
  the stripe along the black-outlined reddish spiracles is yellowish-white;
  head, and plate on first ring of the body, black and shining.</p>

  <p>The moth appears about the end of June or early July, and has been
  noted, in good condition, as late as August 17. It seems to be of very
  local occurrence in England, but some of <!-- Page 2 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="012.png"><a name="page2"></a>{2}</span>its known
  haunts nearest to London are Bromley in Kent, Richmond Park and Norbury
  in Surrey. At Palmer's Green, Middlesex, a specimen was found on an oak
  trunk, July 27, 1902, and a female example came to light in West London
  in 1906. In 1888 it was plentiful at sugar in the Bromley district. The
  New Forest in Hampshire is a noted locality for the species, but although
  it may abound there in some years, in other years it is scarce or
  entirely absent. It is rather more constant in Epping, Romford, and some
  other of the Essex woodlands, and occurs also in Berkshire,
  Huntingdonshire, Northamptonshire, Gloucestershire, and Devon. Odd
  specimens have been recorded from Tarrington, Herefordshire; St. Albans,
  Hertfordshire; and from Tuddenham, Suffolk. The var. <i>renago</i>, and
  its modifications, has been chiefly obtained in Essex and
  Huntingdonshire, but it has been found also in the Reading district, and
  elsewhere.</p>

<h5><b>The Lunar-spotted Pinion</b> (<i>Calymnia pyralina</i>).</h5>

  <p>There are two colour forms of this species; var. <i>corusca</i>, Esp.,
  is rather brighter in colour than the female specimen shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate2">2</a>, Fig. 3, which approaches more nearly the duller
  coloration of the type as described by Vieweg. The latter is perhaps the
  least frequent in England generally, but it occurs sparingly in
  Middlesex.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with whitish warts emitting fine hairs, and
  has three lines along the back, the central one white and stripe-like; a
  yellow stripe low down along the sides is edged above with black. It
  feeds in April and May on elm, oak, apple, plum, etc., among the leaves
  of which it hides by day, and may be dislodged therefrom by jarring the
  boughs. (Plate <a href="#plate3">3</a>, Fig. 2, after Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out from about mid-July to mid-August. On some nights it
  will come freely to sugar and on others it seems more partial to
  honeydew. It is obtained most frequently perhaps in Berkshire, Middlesex,
  Surrey, and Hampshire, but it is also known to occur in Devon, Dorset,
  Sussex, Essex, Suffolk, Cambs., Hunts, Hertfordshire, Oxfordshire,
  Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and South Wales. A specimen has been
  taken at a gas lamp in Chester.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Lesser-spotted Pinion</b> (<i>Calymnia affinis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species varies in the ground colour of the forewings from reddish
  (typical) to greyish brown (var. <i>suffusa</i>, Tutt). A pale
  ochreous-brown form has been named <i>ochrea</i>, Tutt. The cross
  markings and stigmata are sometimes all well defined, but often the
  latter are hardly traceable, the cross lines only distinct on the front
  margin, and the outer one frequently is conspicuously widened. One
  example of each sex is shown on Plate <a href="#plate2">2</a>, Figs. 4
  &#x2642; and 5 &#x2640;.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds on elm from April to June, is of a pale
  green, inclining to whitish green above, the raised dots white; there are
  three white lines on the back, the central one broader and clearer white
  than the others; the lines along the area of the black spiracles are
  whitish; head green and glossy, legs black, pro-legs greenish marked with
  reddish. It feeds at night, and conceals itself between leaves during the
  day.</p>

  <p>The moth appears in July and August, is very partial to sugar and
  "honeydew," and has been taken at light. It lurks among the foliage of
  trees and bushes in the daytime, and may occasionally be dislodged
  therefrom when the boughs are jarred. Although its range extends
  northwards into Yorkshire, where it is local and scarce, the species
  seems to be chiefly obtained in the eastern and southern counties of
  England. No doubt it flourishes best where the elm (<i>Ulmus
  campestris</i>) is most plentiful. In Wales it has been noted from
  Glamorganshire and Flint. <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum" title="016.png"
  ><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span>Kane states that it is very rare in
  Ireland, and I fail to find any record from Scotland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The White-spotted Pinion</b> (<i>Calymnia diffinis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This pretty species is shown on Plate <a href="#plate2">2</a>, Figs. 6
  &#x2642; and 7 &#x2640;. Its colour and marking are little prone to
  variation. Sometimes the ground colour has less red and rather more
  purple in its composition, and in some specimens the white marks on the
  front margin are larger than in others.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale green, with three whitish lines along the
  back; the central of these is rather yellowish, agreeing in tint with the
  usual raised dots, and the outer ones are edged above with bluish green;
  head, brownish, inclining to black below. It feeds at night, in April,
  May, and early June, on the common elm, and rests during the day on the
  undersides of the foliage or between leaves. (Plate <a
  href="#plate3">3</a>, Fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, and is obtained at sugar or at
  light, in almost all parts of England where its favourite tree grows
  freely. It seems to be more local in the Midlands, and appears to be but
  little known in the northern counties, although a specimen was taken at
  sugar in Hazleden Dene, Durham, in the autumn of 1898.</p>

<h5><b>The Dun-bar</b> (<i>Calymnia trapezina</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate2">2</a> will be found portraits of four
  specimens of this variable species. Figs. 8 and 9 represent a male and a
  female of the more ordinary forms. Specimens of the typical whitish or
  greyish buff colour vary in the matter of cross lines, which are well
  defined in the type, but absent in ab. <i>pallida</i>, Tutt. Some
  examples have a reddish central band, and in others the band is blackish
  or black; the latter are referable to ab. <i>badiofasciata</i>, <!-- Page
  5 --><span class="pagenum" title="017.png"><a
  name="page5"></a>{5}</span>Teich. Ab. <i>ochrea</i>, Tutt, is of a
  reddish-tinged ochreous colour with clearly defined cross lines; and ab.
  <i>rufa</i>, Tutt, is red with distinct cross lines. Perhaps the rarest
  form of all is ab. <i>nigra</i>, Tutt, which in ground colour is deep
  blackish grey, with the cross lines faint.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green with black, glossy, raised dots, each
  encircled with white; there are three whitish lines along the back, the
  central one rather wider than the other two; a pale yellowish line along
  the area of the black spiracles; head, green, tinged with dark brown or
  black about the jaws. It feeds, from April to June, on the foliage of
  elm, oak, sallow, and other trees and shrubs; also, be it noted, on other
  caterpillars. The larvæ hunter should therefore get to know this cannibal
  on sight, so that he may exclude it from the common receptacle.</p>

  <p>The moth, which frequents woods and woody country generally, is out in
  July and August.</p>

  <p>The species appears to be common throughout England and Wales, the
  south of Scotland, and more or less frequent northwards up to Moray. It
  is widely spread in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Angle-striped Sallow</b> (<i>Cosmia paleacea</i>).</h5>

  <p>From the typical pale yellowish ochre, the fore wings range in tint to
  a deeper buff, inclining to orange. The transverse lines are brown, or
  sometimes reddish, but are not always distinct, especially in the male.
  The stigmata are not infrequently obscure, but the blackish spot of the
  reniform is generally present. In some examples, chiefly of the female
  sex, there is an angulated dark shade crossing the central area, and some
  dark clouds or dashes on the outer area. (Plate <a href="#plate4">4</a>,
  Fig. 1 &#x2642;.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale dingy green, dusted with whitish, and yellow
  between the rings; three white lines along the back, and a double white
  line along the region of the purplish-edged white spiracles; head, pale
  yellow, the jaws black, and a small red <!-- Page 6 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="018.png"><a name="page6"></a>{6}</span>spot on
  each side above them. (Adapted from Porritt.) It feeds, from April to
  June, on the foliage of birch and aspen, and may be found in the daytime
  between the lower leaves.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in August and September, and at night will visit the
  sugar patch and also heather blossom. It has but few fixed localities in
  England, and these are chiefly in Nottinghamshire (Sherwood Forest), and
  Yorkshire (woods near Doncaster, Huddersfield, and Sheffield). There are,
  however, records of its occurrence in the south of England. Stainton
  obtained one at Lewisham in 1846, and Barrett notes one at Highgate in
  1870. One or two specimens have occurred in Essex, Somersetshire, and
  Gloucestershire. From its headquarters in Notts and Yorks. it seems to
  find its way occasionally into some of the adjoining and other counties.
  Forsythe states that he bred the moth from larvæ obtained from oak at
  Methop, Lancs., and it has been reared from a caterpillar taken in North
  Shropshire. It has occurred on Cannock Chase, Staffs., and rarely in
  Worcestershire.</p>

  <p>From Porritt's <i>List of the Lepidoptera of Yorkshire</i> we learn
  that the occurrence of this species in Yorkshire was not noted until 1880
  (Doncaster), but it seems to have since extended its range in the county,
  as in 1900 it was found in the Huddersfield district, and a few specimens
  occurred near York in 1903. As stated, it has been bred at Methop,
  Lancs., and, according to Barrett, it is not scarce in Cumberland.
  Southwards from its Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire headquarters it has
  been noted, more or less rarely, in Staffordshire, Shropshire,
  Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, and Somerset; and on the east side in
  Lincoln, Norfolk, Essex, and Kent. In Scotland it appears to be not
  uncommon in Moray, and it is occasionally recorded from Inverness and
  Perth. The range abroad extends to Amurland and to North America.</p>

<h5><b>The Suspected</b> (<i>Dyschorista suspecta</i>).</h5>

  <p>Of this species (Plate <a href="#plate4">4</a>, Figs. 2 and 3) there
  are two groups of forms&mdash;plain and variegated. To the first belongs
  the type with reddish-brown fore wings; a dark modification of this form
  is ab. <i>nigrescens</i>, Tutt, which has the fore wings blackish red; a
  brighter red form is ab. <i>rufa</i>, Tutt. Of the variegated sections
  three forms have been named, but the most important of these is var.
  <i>congener</i>, Hübn., with the inner and the outer marginal areas of
  the reddish fore wings ochreous; two other modifications have the ground
  colour redder or dark purplish inclining to blackish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds on birch and sallow in April and May, is
  purplish brown above, and obscure greenish beneath; there are three lines
  along the back, the central one white and distinct, the others less
  defined but noticeable on the black plate on ring nearest the head; on
  each side of the central line are blackish marks; head, ochreous brown,
  streaked with black.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in July and August, and is partial to sugar and to the
  flowers of heather and ragwort. Its chief British quarters appear to be
  in Yorkshire, in which county it was first noted in 1841; thence it
  extends into Lancashire, Cumberland, and Durham, but is local and scarce
  in the latter county. Southwards it is found in the counties of Cheshire
  (locally not uncommon on moors and mosses), Derby, Nottingham, Stafford,
  Shropshire, Warwick, Gloucester (rarely); more locally in Norfolk,
  Suffolk, Essex, and Kent (once at West Wickham). In 1896 it occurred in
  numbers in the New Forest, Hants, and I believe that a solitary specimen
  was secured in Hayling Island in 1901. In Scotland it occurs up to
  Inverness and Aberdeen; and Kane states that in Ireland it is doubtfully
  recorded from Londonderry, but that he has seen lovely forms of the
  species from Killarney. It also occurs in Co. Wicklow. The range abroad
  extends to Siberia, Amurland, and Mongolia. <!-- Page 8 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="022.png"><a name="page8"></a>{8}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Dingy Shears</b> (<i>Dyschorista fissipuncta</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form this species (Plate <a href="#plate4">4</a>, Fig.
  4) has the fore wings pale greyish brown, but occasionally they assume a
  reddish tinge. Var. <i>corticea</i>, Esp., is of the latter colour, and
  has the black edges of the claviform extended to beyond the middle of the
  wing. In another form the fore wings are dark grey brown (Fig. 5),
  leading up to var. <i>nigrescens</i>, Tutt, with blackish fore wings and
  the hind wings darker than usual. Besides the forms just mentioned, I
  have a bred specimen from Canterbury in which the fore wings are of a
  pale whity brown, with very faint markings, and the hind wings are almost
  white; it is rather below the average size, and possibly is an abnormal
  aberration. This species is the <i>ypsilon</i> of Borkhausen, and the
  <i>upsilon</i> of other authors.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brown, sometimes inclining to reddish marked with
  black above, and the under surface is paler; there are three pale lines
  along the back, and one low down along each side; head, pale brown
  freckled with darker brown. It feeds in April and May on willows, chiefly
  the narrow-leaved kind, and also, although less frequently perhaps, on
  poplar. These caterpillars may often be found in the daytime under loose
  bark of the willow, or lurking among grass roots or <i>débris</i> around
  the trunk. (Fig. 1 on Plate <a href="#plate3">3</a> is from a coloured
  drawing by Mr. A. Sich.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out from late June through July. It is a constant visitor
  to the sugar patch, and will put in an appearance even when other species
  refuse to be drawn thereto. It appears to be pretty well distributed over
  England, and in the southern half at least is not uncommon, wherever
  there are old-established willows. In the northern counties it seems to
  be much less frequent, but it is recorded as common or plentiful in one
  or two Cheshire localities, and is said to be taken by all the Newcastle
  <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum" title="023.png"><a
  name="page9"></a>{9}</span>collectors. In Scotland it has been noted in
  only a few localities. Abroad, the range extends to Amurland.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Mesogona acetosellæ</i>, Fabricius.&mdash;Mr. R. Adkin has a
  specimen of this Central and South European species. It was taken at
  sugar on the evening of October 26th, 1895, by Mr. T. Salvage, in his
  garden at Arlington, Sussex (<i>Entomologist</i>, xxviii. p. 316).</p>

<h5><b>The Double Kidney</b> (<i>Plastenis retusa</i>).</h5>

  <p>This olive-brown species, shown on Plate <a href="#plate4">4</a>, Fig.
  7, has a reddish-tinged form&mdash;ab. <i>gracilis</i>, Haw.&mdash;but
  otherwise there is little to be noted in the way of variation. The
  caterpillar is pale green with three whitish lines on the back, and a
  narrower and more irregular whitish line low down along the sides; head,
  yellowish green, or dark brown. Sometimes the body has a yellowish tinge
  at each end. It feeds on the foliage of sallow and willow, from April to
  June, drawing together the terminal leaves of a shoot as a retreat.</p>

  <p>The moth is on the wing in July and August, and is more frequently
  attracted at night to the aphis secretion known as "honeydew" than to the
  sugar patch, although it does not ignore the latter altogether, and
  occasionally enters the illuminated moth trap. Barrett states that he has
  found it at the flowers of figwort (<i>Scrophularia aquatica</i>).
  Apparently a local species, but found more or less frequently in most of
  the southern and eastern counties of England, and through the Midlands to
  Cheshire, Lancashire, and Yorkshire; it is, however, rarely seen in the
  three last-named counties.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Olive</b> (<i>Plastenis subtusa</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth is shown on Plate <a href="#plate4">4</a>, Fig. 6. It is
  somewhat similar in general appearance to the last mentioned, but the
  <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum" title="024.png"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span>colour of the fore wings is greyer; the
  cross lines are not parallel, and the outer margins of these wings are
  less irregular. The caterpillar is greenish, with black dots, and white
  lines along the back and sides; the head and plate on the first ring of
  the body black. It feeds, on poplar and aspen, in April and May. By day
  these caterpillars may be found spun up between two leaves or in a folded
  leaf. The moth is out in July and August, but is rarely noticed in the
  daytime, although at night, when it becomes active, it may be obtained,
  sometimes not altogether uncommonly, at honeydew, or in much fewer
  numbers at sugar or light. The best way to obtain the species is to
  search for the caterpillars, which are not at all difficult to rear. Most
  of them, however, prefer the higher foliage of well-grown aspen or
  poplar, where they may be seen but not readily secured; but I have
  generally found as many as I wanted within reach.</p>

  <p>The species seems to have a wide distribution throughout England, and
  Scotland up to Moray, its occurrence in any locality depending on the
  presence of the poplar or aspen. The range abroad extends to Eastern
  Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>The Centre-barred Sallow</b> (<i>Cirrh&oelig;dia</i> (<i>Atethmia</i>) <i>xerampelina</i>).</h5>

  <p>The typical form of this pretty species has the fore wings yellow,
  with a purplish-red central band. The band, which fills up the space
  between the first and second lines, is rarely carried through to the
  front margins of the wing, but usually is only fragmentary above the
  reniform stigma, which forms part of it; it also varies in the intensity
  of the purple tint. In most British specimens the band varies as
  indicated above, but the general colour of the fore wings is
  orange-yellow (Plate <a href="#plate4">4</a>, Fig. 8)&mdash;ab.
  <i>centrago</i>, Haw.&mdash;the hind marginal band agreeing in colour
  with that of the central band. Or the fore wings may assume the colour of
  Fig. 9, var. <i>unicolor</i>, Staud., but this form is rare in Britain,
  although it is known to occur in the Isle of Man, and has been recorded
  from Ripon, Skipworth, and York, also from Derbyshire, Staffordshire,
  Notts, Lincoln, and Gloucestershire. The caterpillar is brownish,
  inclining to greyish above and to greenish grey beneath, freckled with
  darker brown; of the three whitish lines along the back, the central one
  is widest, but is only really distinct on the middle part of each ring;
  the lines are margined with black, the edging of the central one
  irregular, but of the others more complete; the spiracles are whitish,
  and the area above them is dark grey-brown enclosing paler spaces on each
  ring; head, shining grey-brown freckled with blackish. It feeds, in
  April, May, and June, on ash, and until the leaves expand it is content
  with the buds. After dark it may be beaten from saplings in the hedgerow,
  as well as from full-grown trees. By day it hides among moss or litter,
  or in the crevices of bark, and at dark may be found crawling up the
  trunks of ash trees.</p>

  <p>The moths are out in August and September, and in the late afternoon
  may be seen, newly emerged from the chrysalis, on ash trunks, or on twigs
  and herbage immediately around the tree stems. When on the wing at night
  it is attracted by light, especially electric, and by sugar. Now that the
  habits of the species are better known than formerly, it has been
  ascertained to occur in most English counties. In Scotland it is widely
  distributed up to Argyll and Perthshire; it has been recorded from
  several parts of Wales, and in Ireland is found in counties Antrim,
  Tyrone, Fermanagh, Down, Armagh, Louth, Westmeath, Wicklow, Sligo,
  Galway, Tipperary, and Cork.</p>

<h5><b>The Lunar Underwing</b> (<i>Omphaloscelis</i> (<i>Anchocelis</i>) <i>lunosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>In the general colour of the fore wings, this species, of which four
  figures will be found on Plate <a href="#plate7">7</a>, ranges from pale
  ochreous <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum" title="028.png"><a
  name="page12"></a>{12}</span>brown to dark blackish grey. The typical
  form (<i>lunosa</i>, Haworth) has the ground colour pale, or bright,
  reddish (Figs. 1 and 3); the markings are well defined, and the wing rays
  are sometimes pale ochreous, or whitish. Four modifications of this form
  have been named; one of these has pale veins, but the general colour is
  red brown (ab. <i>brunnea</i>, Tutt); in another (Fig. 2) the colour is
  ochreous brown, the veins pale, and the other markings distinct (ab.
  <i>humilis</i>, Humph. and Westw.). Of the greyish forms, var.
  <i>agrotoïdes</i>, Guenée, is the darkest (Fig. 4).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brownish, inclining to greenish beneath; there are
  three whitish lines along the back, the outer edged below with blackish;
  a thin whitish line along the sides is shaded above with blackish. It
  feeds on meadow grass (<i>Poa annua</i>), and other kinds of grass, from
  October to May. The moth appears in September and October, sometimes at
  the end of August. It is partial to light and to sugar, and where the
  latter is smeared over the foliage of trees and bushes it seems better
  attended by this, and other autumnal moths, than when painted on
  tree-trunks in the usual manner.</p>

  <p>The species seems to be pretty generally distributed throughout
  Southern and Western England, and in some seasons it is very common.
  Eastward and through the Midlands it is perhaps less frequent; in the
  northern counties it is scarce on the east, but locally common on the
  west. It occurs in Wales; also in Scotland up to Perthshire. According to
  Kane, it is widely distributed in Ireland, but most common on the
  coast.</p>

  <p>Abroad, it appears to be confined to France and Spain, although it has
  been recorded from North-west Africa.</p>

<h5><b>The Red-line Quaker</b> (<i>Amathes</i> (<i>Orthosia</i>) <i>lota</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form this species is of a leaden-grey coloration on the
  fore wings, but these wings sometimes have a reddish <!-- Page 13
  --><span class="pagenum" title="029.png"><a
  name="page13"></a>{13}</span>tinge (ab. <i>rufa</i>, Tutt). In others the
  ground colour is blackish (ab. <i>suffusa</i>, Tutt), and a rarer form
  (ab. <i>pallida</i>, Tutt) has the fore wings whitish grey with a
  distinct black reniform stigma, and red submarginal line. (Plate <a
  href="#plate7">7</a>, Figs. 5, 6.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous brown, sometimes tinged with reddish or
  purplish brown on the sides; of three whitish lines along the back, the
  central one is composed of spots, and the outer ones are not well
  defined, except on the dark first and last rings; the line along the
  sides is reddish. Head, glossy, pale reddish brown, marked with darker
  brown. It feeds on willow and sallow, and may be found among the foliage
  from April to June, and especially the topmost leaves of a twig, which it
  spins together with silk to form a retreat during the day. (Plate <a
  href="#plate5">5</a>, Fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>The moth comes freely to sugar in September and October, sometimes
  even later. It may be found pretty freely also at ivy bloom, and at the
  flowers of <i>Tritoma</i>. Although apparently commoner in the south, it
  is generally distributed throughout England, Wales, and Scotland up to
  Perthshire and Aberdeen. In Ireland it is widely distributed, but
  local.</p>

<h5><b>The Yellow-line Quaker</b> (<i>Amathes</i> (<i>Orthosia</i>) <i>macilenta</i>).</h5>

  <p>The typical coloration of this species (Plate <a href="#plate7">7</a>,
  Figs. 7 and 8) is pale ochreous brown, inclining to reddish in some
  specimens; the lower part of the reniform stigma black. Sometimes, the
  black spot is absent (ab. <i>obsoleta</i>, Tutt). Another form has the
  ground colour pale yellowish brown, and this, with the black lower
  portion of the reniform present, is ab. <i>straminea</i>, Tutt, while
  specimens of the same tint, but minus the black spot, are referable to
  ab. <i>obsoleta-straminea</i> of the same author.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is reddish brown with white dots, and three white
  lines on the back; the line along the spiracles is whitish <!-- Page 14
  --><span class="pagenum" title="030.png"><a
  name="page14"></a>{14}</span>with a dusky edge above. Head, ochreous
  brown; plate on first ring blackish lined with white. It feeds on beech,
  oak, and heather. When approaching full growth it probably feeds on
  low-growing plants, and it may be found from April to June.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in September and October, sometimes in November.
  Decaying apples seem to have a stronger attractive influence at times
  than either sugar or ivy bloom. Except that it appears to be local or
  scarce in the Midlands, the species occurs, in many parts commonly,
  throughout England, Wales, and Scotland to Moray. In Ireland it is
  generally distributed and abundant in some localities.</p>

<h5><b>The Brick</b> (<i>Amathes</i> (<i>Orthosia</i>) <i>circellaris</i>).</h5>

  <p>Yellow or ochreous is the typical coloration, but the most frequent
  form of this common species in Britain is ab. <i>ferruginea</i>, Hübn.,
  which is ochreous tinged with rust colour. Sometimes, the fore wings are
  more or less suffused with blackish, and with the markings black, such
  specimens are referable to <i>macilenta</i> as figured by Hübner, Noct.,
  Fig. 688. The more usual form is shown on Plate <a href="#plate7">7</a>,
  Figs. 9, 10.</p>

  <p>At the time it is freshly laid, the egg (Plate <a
  href="#plate5">5</a>, Fig. 3<i>a</i>) is yellowish, but changes in about
  a week to purplish with a more or less distinct pearly sheen.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brown inclining to yellowish, the head is reddish,
  and the plate on first ring blackish; there are three pale lines along
  the back, the central one more or less interrupted by dusky V-shaped
  marks, the others with an interrupted edging above; the stripe along the
  region of the blackish spiracles is yellowish grey. It lives on wych-elm
  and ash, eating the flowers, seeds, and leaves, but has a decided
  preference for the first two. It may be beaten in May and early June,
  sometimes in numbers, from the seeds (Plate <a href="#plate5">5</a>, Fig.
  3).</p>

  <p>The moth is out from late August well on into October, and is to be
  found, wherever its favourite trees are established, throughout the
  British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>The Flounced Rustic</b> (<i>Amathes</i> (<i>Orthosia</i>) <i>helvola</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate9">9</a> is shown a male specimen of the
  typical form (Fig. 1). In ab. <i>ochrea</i>, Tutt, the general colour of
  the fore wings is ochreous with a greenish tinge, and so it differs from
  the type, in which the ground colour is reddish. In another ochreous form
  the cross bands are of a purplish tint (ab. <i>punica</i>, Borkhausen),
  and in ab. <i>rufina</i>, Hübner, the bands are also purplish, but the
  ground colour is of a somewhat brighter red than in the type. Ab.
  <i>unicolor</i>, Tutt, is dull reddish with indistinct cross markings,
  and seems to be a modification of the almost unicolorous form of a bright
  red colour, ab. <i>rufa</i>, Tutt. (Fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>The full-grown caterpillar feeds, in April and May, on the foliage of
  the oak, the elm, and some other trees; also on sallow, hawthorn, and,
  according to Barrett, on bilberry and heather. In general colour it is
  brownish, often tinged with red, and more or less flecked with dark
  brown; a fine whitish line along the middle of the back is only clearly
  traceable on the front rings, but there is a very distinct white stripe
  along the region of the black spiracles. In an earlier stage it is green
  with three whitish lines on the back, and another on the sides.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in September and October, rather earlier in Scotland.
  Though much commoner in some districts than in others, this species is
  found in woodlands throughout the greater part of England, Wales, and the
  mainland of Scotland. In Ireland it appears to be rare, and has only been
  recorded, chiefly in single specimens, from Waterford, Wicklow, Galway,
  Armagh, and Derry. <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum" title="034.png"
  ><a name="page16"></a>{16}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Beaded Chestnut</b> (<i>Amathes</i> (<i>Orthosia</i>) <i>lychnidis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The name of this variable species (Plate <a href="#plate9">9</a>,
  Figs. 3-6), long known as <i>pistacina</i>, is now recognised as the
  <i>lychnidis</i> of Schiffermiller, so, as the latter name has page
  priority over the former, it has to be adopted. Fig. 3 on the plate
  represents a well-marked reddish specimen of the typical form. A great
  many forms have been named, but only a few of the more distinct of these
  can be referred to here. Fig. 4 shows the greyish ochreous aberration
  known as <i>serrina</i>, Fab. Ab. <i>ferrea</i>, Haworth (Fig. 5) has
  almost uniform reddish fore wings, and ab. <i>venosa</i>, Haworth has the
  fore wings greyish brown with the veins whitish.</p>

  <p>When newly laid the egg (Plate <a href="#plate5">5</a>, Fig.
  1<i>a</i>) is yellowish, but changes to olive-brown. The caterpillar
  (Plate <a href="#plate5">5</a>, Fig. 1) is green inclining to yellowish,
  freckled with greyish, and dotted with whitish; there are three fine
  whitish lines along the back, and a broad white stripe along the sides.
  It is found from March to June, and feeds on grasses, dandelion,
  groundsel, buttercup, and a variety of low plants; it will also eat
  sallow.</p>

  <p>The moth is out from September to November, and is often abundant at
  sugar and ivy bloom, and not uncommon on gas lamps or around electric
  lights. Generally distributed and plentiful over the greater part of
  England and Wales, but from Yorkshire northwards and through Scotland to
  Perthshire it is very local, and apparently not at all frequent. In
  Ireland it is widely spread and common.</p>

<h5><b>The Brown-spot Pinion</b> (<i>Amathes</i> (<i>Orthosia</i>) <i>litura</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate9">9</a> are shown specimens from Scotland
  (Figs. 8 &#x2642;, 9 &#x2640;). The male, which has the basal area of the
  fore wings pale, is referable to ab. <i>borealis</i>, Sparre-Schneider,
  whilst the female is more nearly typical. In England the majority of the
  <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum" title="035.png"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>specimens belong to ab. <i>rufa</i>, Tutt,
  which is reddish in the coloration of fore wing (Fig. 7). Sometimes the
  basal area in this colour form is pale also.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, sometimes tinged with olive and freckled
  with darker green; there are three dark-edged pale-green lines along the
  back; the under surface is tinged with yellowish, and is separated from
  the green colour of the upper surface by a whitish stripe, edged above
  with black; head, brownish, with darker freckles. It occurs in April and
  May, when it feeds on bramble, rose, oak, sallow, and some low-growing
  plants.</p>

  <p>The moth is found in September and October throughout England, and
  Scotland up to Moray.</p>

<h5><b>The Orange Sallow</b> (<i>Cirrhia</i> (<i>Xanthia</i>) <i>citrago</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour of the fore wings is generally yellow, but in some
  districts the specimens exhibit a tendency towards orange-red. The latter
  tint is very decided in var. <i>aurantiago</i>, Tutt. There is but little
  variation in marking, but the central cross line is broader in some
  specimens than in others. (Plate <a href="#plate10">10</a>, Fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is dark olive-grey above, with white dots, and obscure
  greenish beneath; of the three whitish lines along the back, the central
  one is rather wider than the other two, which are edged above with black;
  along the region of the spiracles the colour is whitish grey. Head,
  brown, shining, and darker on the mouth; a black mark on ring of body
  next the head. (Adapted from Porritt.) It feeds on lime (<i>Tilia
  vulgaris</i>) in April and May, and conceals itself between two
  spun-together leaves during the daytime. In such retreats I have
  frequently detected them by simply standing under the branches and
  looking upwards and outwards from the trunk. When nearly full grown they
  more often descend the tree, and hide by day <!-- Page 18 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="036.png"><a name="page18"></a>{18}</span>among the
  undergrowth, etc., at the base of the trunk, whence they return to their
  feeding quarters by crawling up the tree at dusk.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in August and September, and although it does not seem
  to care much about the collector's sugar when spread on tree trunks in
  the usual way, it seems to accept it freely enough when daubed on the
  foliage. The leaves of the lime are, however, generally well coated with
  a sweet substance proceeding from <i>Aphides</i>, and commonly known as
  honeydew. This in itself is very attractive to the moths. The species
  seems to be widely distributed over England, and will perhaps be found in
  most districts where limes flourish. In Wales it has occurred in
  Flintshire, Denbighshire, and Carnarvon. McArthur obtained a specimen in
  the Isle of Lewis in 1887, and Renton records it as found in
  Roxburghshire. Little is known of it from Ireland, but it has been noted
  from Wicklow and Galway.</p>

<h5><b>The Barred Sallow</b> (<i>Ochria</i> (<i>Xanthia</i>) <i>aurago</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour of the fore wings, which in the type is pale yellow,
  ranges through various shades of yellow to deep orange. The basal and
  outer marginal bands are pale purplish, in the type, but in the more
  orange forms the bands are rather more reddish purple. In ab.
  <i>fucata</i>, Esper, the purplish colour of the bands spreads over the
  orange central area, and in ab. <i>unicolor</i>, Tutt, the orange invades
  the basal and outer marginal regions, so that the bands are pretty well
  obliterated, and the fore wings assume a more or less uniform orange
  coloration. The latter form is uncommon, but a rarer one in this country
  is ab. <i>lutea</i>, Tutt, which has the fore wings almost entirely
  orange-yellow. (Plate <a href="#plate10">10</a>, Figs. 2 and 3, the
  latter inclining to ab. <i>unicolor</i>.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is reddish brown with pale dots, and with <!-- Page 19
  --><span class="pagenum" title="037.png"><a
  name="page19"></a>{19}</span>three whitish lines along the back; a pale
  stripe along the sides. Head, pale brown, shining. May be found from
  April to June on beech, or on maple where this occurs around beech woods.
  At first it feeds on the buds, but later on the leaves; for protection
  during the day it spins together two of the leaves, and so forms a
  suitable resting place. Sycamore, it may be mentioned, is acceptable to
  this caterpillar when reared in captivity.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in September and early October, and is chiefly found
  in the neighbourhood of beech woods, especially those in chalky districts
  in Oxford and adjoining counties, Hertfordshire, Middlesex, Essex,
  Suffolk, Norfolk, Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Wilts, Somerset, Dorset, and
  Devon. It also occurs in the counties of Hereford, Worcester, and
  Cheshire; it has been found in Yorkshire since 1890 in several
  localities, including Barnsley, Doncaster, Huddersfield, and Rotherham.
  At least one specimen has been recorded from Pembrokeshire, and others
  from Flint and Denbighshire, in Wales.</p>

<h5><b>The Pink-barred Sallow</b> (<i>Xanthia lutea</i> (<i>flavago</i>)).</h5>

  <p>In some examples of this species (Plate <a href="#plate10">10</a>,
  Figs. 4, 5) the oblique band of the fore wings is purplish, and in others
  red or reddish; the former are typical, and the latter are referable to
  ab. <i>ochreago</i>, Borkhausen. Often the band is incomplete, and
  sometimes it is only indicated by three more or less regular series of
  reddish dots (ab. <i>togata</i>, Esper). I have one example of this form
  from the Isle of Hoy, and another specimen from the same locality is
  somewhat similar, but the spots are not so well separated, and are
  purplish in colour.</p>

  <p>The eggs (Plate <a href="#plate6">6</a>, Fig. 3) are yellowish when
  laid, but become purplish later, and the ribs then appear whitish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar when young lives on catkins of the sallow, and when
  these fall it feeds on low-growing plants, but it will <!-- Page 20
  --><span class="pagenum" title="038.png"><a
  name="page20"></a>{20}</span>eat the leaves of sallow and the seeds of
  wych-elm. It may be found from March to June.</p>

  <p>The moth appears in September and October. It is widely distributed,
  and often common at the sugar patch, over the whole of England, Wales,
  Scotland up to Moray, and Ireland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland, Japan, Kamtschatka, and North
  America.</p>

<h5><b>The Sallow</b> (<i>Xanthia fulvago</i>).</h5>

  <p>A typical male and female of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate10">10</a>, Figs. 7, 8; Fig. 6 on the same plate represents
  ab. <i>flavescens</i>, Esper. Sometimes the fore wings are orange-tinged,
  and such examples having the typical markings well defined are referable
  to ab. <i>aurantia</i>, Tutt. In <i>cerago</i>, Hübner, the markings are
  fainter than in the type, and the orange-yellow modification of this form
  has been named <i>imperfecta</i>, Tutt.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brown above with a tinge of red or purple, and
  freckled with darker; there are three pale lines along the back, but only
  the central one is distinct, and this is more or less interrupted by
  clusters of darker freckles; there is a darker stripe composed of
  freckles on the sides, and below this is a pale brownish stripe; head,
  brown, plate on the first ring of the body blackish with pale lines upon
  it. It feeds when young in sallow catkins, and later on low-growing
  plants, also leaves of sallow and seeds of wych-elm. Early stages are
  figured on Plate <a href="#plate6">6</a>. The moth is out in September
  and early October. It is widely distributed, and generally common,
  throughout England and Wales, Scotland to Moray, and Ireland. Its range
  abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note</span>.&mdash;It may be stated here that the
  present species, together with <i>aurago</i>, <i>lutea</i>,
  <i>fulvago</i>, <i>gilvago</i>, and <i>ocellaris</i>, are referred to
  <i>Cosmia</i>, Ochs. and Treit., by Hampson (<i>Cat. Lep. Phal.</i> vi.
  497).</p>

<h5><b>The Dusky-lemon Sallow</b> (<i>Mellinia</i> (<i>Xanthia</i>) <i>gilvago</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two examples of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate10">10</a>, Figs. 9 and 10. The purplish-brown mottling or
  clouding and greyish suffusion of the fore wings is much denser in some
  specimens than in others. Often the suffusion is quite absent, and the
  purplish brown is only seen as spots. Again, in an almost unicolorous
  form the ground colour is of a pale orange tint, the cross markings and
  outlines of the reniform are as in the type, and the series of blackish
  points on the submarginal line, usually present in the type, are more
  conspicuous, owing to absence of the other usual dark markings; this
  seems to be the <i>palleago</i> of Hübner, which has been considered a
  distinct species; I think, however, that it is only a form of
  <i>gilvago</i>. The earliest recorded British specimen of this form was
  taken at Brighton in 1856, and it and others captured in the same
  district were then thought to be examples of <i>M. ocellaris</i>, but
  their true identity was established by Doubleday in 1859. Very few
  specimens of this form have been reported from other parts of England,
  but I have recently seen one that was taken at light in the Canterbury
  district, Kent, on October 3, 1907. In its typical form this species has
  an extensive range in England, spreading from Yorkshire to Surrey and
  Sussex. The earliest known British specimens were captured in the
  neighbourhood of Doncaster over sixty years ago, but its occurrence in
  Surrey seems not to have been noted until comparatively recent times.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pinkish grey-brown, with three paler lines and a
  series of purplish diamonds along the back; the sides are mottled with
  purplish brown above the black spiracles, and striped with ochreous grey
  below them. According to Buckler, whose description is here adapted, the
  four pale raised dots circled with dark brown, placed within the dark
  marks on the back of each ring, serve to distinguish this caterpillar
  from its <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum" title="042.png"><a
  name="page22"></a>{22}</span>allies. It feeds on the seeds of wych-elm,
  and may be beaten or jarred from the branches in April and May. The moth
  is out in the autumn.</p>

<h5><b>The Pale-lemon Sallow</b> (<i>Mellinia</i> (<i>Xanthia</i>) <i>ocellaris</i>).</h5>

  <p>Although sparsely marked yellowish examples of the last species have
  been mistaken for the present one, the true <i>M. ocellaris</i> was not
  known to occur in Britain until 1893, when three specimens were taken at
  Wimbledon and Twickenham. In 1894 a specimen was recorded from Bognor in
  Sussex, and another in West Dulwich. The following year one specimen was
  taken at Richmond, Surrey, and one at Ipswich, Suffolk. Three specimens
  were obtained at sugar in 1899, and five others in 1900, in a locality in
  North Kent. Odd specimens have also been noted as follows:&mdash;Suffolk,
  Beccles (1898), Woodbridge (1899); West Norfolk (1904 and 1906);
  Cambridge (1907). The caterpillar, which is ochreous grey with black
  dots, feeds on poplar, and is stated by one continental author to live in
  the buds and catkins when young, and afterwards on low plants. So far, it
  has not been detected in England.</p>

  <p>A German specimen of the moth is depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate10">10</a>, Fig. 11. From the last species this one is easily
  separated by the more pointed fore wings, by the white dot at lower end
  of the reniform stigma, and by the different shaped cross lines.</p>

  <p>The moth has been taken at sugar or light in September and
  October.</p>

<h5><b>The Orange Upper-wing</b> (<i>Xantholeuca</i> (<i>Hoporina</i>) <i>croceago</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species is shown in its typical form on Plate <a
  href="#plate10">10</a>, Fig. 12. Occasionally a dull reddish-brown form
  (ab. <i>latericolor</i>, Raynor) occurs, of which I some years ago reared
  several examples, <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum" title="043.png"
  ><a name="page23"></a>{23}</span>from eggs laid by a female taken at
  sallow in Darenth Wood, Kent.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate6">6</a>, Fig. 1) is pale
  ochreous brown, inclining to orange, finely freckled with brown, and with
  brown V-marks on the back of rings 4 to 11; the line along the middle of
  the back is pale yellow, and there are two pale yellow spots on ring 11;
  head, pale brown, freckled with darker brown, and sometimes rosy tinged.
  It feeds on oak, and may be found in May and June.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in September and October, and then visits ivy bloom and
  sugar at night; after hibernation it comes to sallow bloom. It has been
  found during the winter between dry leaves on oak twigs in the hedgerows.
  Females taken late in the spring and enclosed in a chip box will probably
  deposit a good supply of eggs; caterpillars hatching from them are not
  difficult to rear.</p>

  <p>The species does not appear to have been noticed in the eastern or
  northern counties of England, but it occurs from Worcester southwards to
  Somerset, Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall. From Herefordshire it spreads into
  Wales. North of London it is found in Hertfordshire, Middlesex, and to
  the south in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire.</p>

  <p>It is represented in Japan by <i>sericea</i>, Butler, which is
  considered a distinct species by some authors.</p>

<h5><b>The Red-headed Chestnut</b> (<i>Orrhodia</i> (<i>Conistra</i>) <i>erythrocephala</i>).</h5>

  <p>The portraits of this species on Plate <a href="#plate11">11</a> are
  from Austrian specimens. Fig. 1 is typical and Fig. 2 is ab.
  <i>glabra</i>, Hübner.</p>

  <p>A specimen was captured at Marlow, Bucks, in October, 1859, by Mr. A.
  H. Clarke, who presented it to the British Museum in 1903; but perhaps
  the earliest-known British specimen was one taken near Brighton in 1847.
  Between the <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum" title="044.png"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>last-named Sussex locality and Eastbourne in
  one direction, and Lewes in the other, one or more specimens of the type
  or of ab. <i>glabra</i> have occurred from time to time, but there are no
  records from the county for a number of years now. The species has also
  been noted from Hampshire (New Forest and Bournemouth), Somerset, Devon,
  Kent (Darenth), and Hertfordshire (St. Albans). The most recent records
  refer to two captures at Bournemouth in 1902.</p>

<h5><b>The Chestnut</b> (<i>Orrhodia</i> (<i>Conistra</i>) <i>vaccinii</i>).</h5>

  <p>Figure 3 on Plate <a href="#plate11">11</a> represents this species in
  its typical form, which is of a dark chestnut colour, and almost without
  markings. The brighter red modification of this form has been named ab.
  <i>rufa</i>, Tutt; while another assuming the blacker hue of <i>O.
  ligula</i> has been described as ab. <i>unicolor</i>, Tutt. In some of
  the redder forms the cross lines are dark and conspicuous, thus
  approaching ab. <i>spadicea</i>, Hübner, which has distinct black lines
  as seen in Fig. 6. It should be noted that the figure just referred to is
  from a German specimen, as I was unable to obtain a suitable British
  example of the form. Another far more frequent form of this variable
  species is ab. <i>mixta</i>, Staud. (Fig. 4), in which the ground colour
  is ochreous, more or less tinged with red; the more yellow-coloured
  examples of this form have been separated under the name <i>ochrea</i>,
  Tutt. Figure 5 shows a form that is rather less common than either of
  those just adverted to; the specimen is one of a short series from Kent
  that I have labelled ab. <i>suffusa</i>, Tutt; as will be noticed, the
  band on the outer area is in strong contrast to the rest of the fore
  wings. Apart from the above and other named forms, there is considerable
  aberration in the markings, and more especially as regards the stigmata.
  The lower extremity of the reniform is usually black or blackish, but it
  may be very faint or entirely absent, and as a contrast <!-- Page 25
  --><span class="pagenum" title="045.png"><a
  name="page25"></a>{25}</span>to this, the orbicular sometimes has a
  blackish dot at its lower end.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds, in May and June, on oak, elm, etc., and also
  upon low-growing plants. It is reddish brown above, and greenish beneath,
  sometimes the upper surface is tinged with green also; the back is
  freckled with pale brown, and the three lines along it are faintly paler,
  the raised dots are whitish; head, glossy pale brown, freckled with
  reddish-brown, and lined with darker brown.</p>

  <p>The moth occurs at sugar, ivy bloom, etc., in the autumn and early
  winter, also at sallow catkins in the spring, in probably almost all
  wooded localities throughout the British Isles.</p>

  <p>Its range abroad extends to Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Dark Chestnut</b> (<i>Orrhodia</i> (<i>Conistra</i>) <i>ligula</i>).</h5>

  <p>Four examples of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate11">11</a>. The typical form has a white band on the outer
  area of the fore wings (Fig. 7); sometimes this band is ochreous (ab.
  <i>subnigra</i>, Haworth), and a modification of this, in which the
  outlines of the stigmata and the veins are pale, is var. <i>ochrea</i>,
  Tutt. Ab. <i>polita</i>, Hübner (Fig. 9), has a whitish-grey submarginal
  band and greyish cross lines, and ab. <i>spadicea</i>, Haworth (Fig. 10),
  is a dark form without any distinct markings. This species has long been
  incorrectly known as <i>spadicea</i>, Hübner, which, as noted above, is a
  form of <i>vaccinii</i>, L. Staudinger, probably to prevent confusion,
  deposed <i>spadicea</i>, Haworth, and set up <i>subspadicea</i> in its
  place.</p>

  <p>Fig. 8 represents a specimen from North Kent that somewhat suggests
  ab. <i>suffusa</i>, Tutt, of the previous species. On comparing the outer
  marginal contour of the fore wings of these closely allied species, it
  will be noted that in all forms of <i>ligula</i> the margin below the tip
  is always slightly concave, thus giving <!-- Page 26 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="046.png"><a name="page26"></a>{26}</span>the wings
  a decidedly pointed tip, a character which will serve to distinguish
  <i>ligula</i> from <i>vaccinii</i> in nearly every instance.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is reddish brown, freckled with paler; the three pale
  lines along the back are distinctly white on the plate on ring 1, the
  outer lines edged below with brownish; spiracles outlined in black, and
  the stripe along them is reddish ochreous. It feeds in spring and early
  summer, at first on oak, sallow, and hawthorn, and afterwards on
  low-growing weeds.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in October and November, and as it lives through the
  winter is seen at sugar on any mild night, but it does not seem to turn
  up at the sallow catkins in the spring. The species is rather less
  generally distributed than the last, but it is not uncommon in the
  southern and eastern counties, and is found throughout England to the
  Tyne. Recorded from very few localities in Ireland, and apparently not
  noticed in Scotland.</p>

<h5><b>The Dotted Chestnut</b> (<i>Orrhodia</i> (<i>Dasycampa</i>) <i>rubiginea</i>).</h5>

  <p>A pair of typical specimens are represented on Plate <a
  href="#plate11">11</a>, Figs. 11 and 12. A form of the species occurring
  in Somersetshire has the fore wings reddish brown, and the usual black
  dots are largely absent (ab. <i>unicolor</i>, Tutt).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate6">6</a>, Fig. 2) is purplish
  brown freckled with blackish; there are three obscure paler lines along
  the back from ring 3, and a central series of black spots; the head is
  black, and the fine hairs of the body are yellowish brown. It feeds, in
  May and June, on apple, plum, dandelion, etc. The fact has been noted
  that, if supplied with apple until about half grown, and afterwards with
  dandelion, it attains full size more quickly than when kept to one kind
  of food only.</p>

  <p>The moth appears in October and November, retires during the cold
  weather, and comes forth again in the spring. When <!-- Page 27 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="047.png"><a name="page27"></a>{27}</span>reared in
  confinement, it emerges from the chrysalis about a month earlier. Ivy
  bloom, ripe yew berries, and also sugar attract it in the autumn, and in
  the spring it visits the blossoms of sallow, damson, and sloe. There are
  several records of its having been taken at light, perhaps the latest of
  these being that of a specimen captured at Exeter on April 11, 1906.</p>

  <p>Except in Devonshire, where it is of more regular occurrence, the
  species is far from common in England, but is taken in, or has been
  recorded from, the counties of Dorset, Wilts, Gloucester, Hereford,
  Monmouth (S. Wales), Hants and Isle of Wight, Sussex, Surrey, Berks,
  Bucks, and Cambridge. In Ireland it is noted from Dublin, King's County,
  Kerry, Wicklow, and Galway.</p>

  <p>It is represented in Japan by the larger ab. <i>fornax</i>,
  Butler.</p>

<h5><b>The Satellite</b> (<i>Eupsilia</i> (<i>Scopelosoma</i>) <i>satellitia</i>).</h5>

  <p>An example of each sex of this species is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate12">12</a>, together with a less common form. Although
  specimens vary in the amount of red in the colour of the fore wings,
  there is more striking aberration in the colour of the lunular marks
  representing the reniform stigma; these are frequently white, but may be
  yellow (typical), or reddish orange in either sex. The dull brownish
  specimen (Fig. 3) is from Yorkshire, and appears to be referable to var.
  <i>brunnea</i>, Lampa.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is dark brown, with indistinct paler lines on the
  back; the line along the spiracles is white or whitish, but often reduced
  to a series of spots on rings 1, 2, 5, and 11. Head, ochreous-brown,
  darker about the mouth. It feeds, in May and June, on the leaves of oak,
  beech, elm, and other trees, also on low plants; and has a keen appetite,
  it is said, for other caterpillars when the opportunity offers.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in September, and may be seen at ivy bloom or sugar
  during that month, and also in October and November <!-- Page 28 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="048.png"><a name="page28"></a>{28}</span>if the
  weather is favourable; it is early on the wing again in the spring.</p>

  <p>Although apparently uncommon in some few parts, the species seems to
  be generally distributed and plentiful throughout England, Wales,
  Scotland up to Ross (recorded from Stromma, Orkney), and Ireland.</p>

  <p>In Japan, a greyish form with larger spots (ab. <i>tripuncta</i>,
  Butler) occurs.</p>

<h5><b>The Tawny Pinion</b> (<i>Lithophane</i> (<i>Xylina</i>) <i>semibrunnea</i>).</h5>

  <p>An example of this species is represented on Plate <a
  href="#plate12">12</a>, Fig. 4. The black streak from above the middle of
  the inner margin towards the hind margin should be noted, as this
  character distinguishes <i>semibrunnea</i> from dark forms of the
  following species&mdash;<i>L. socia.</i></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish green, with a broad creamy stripe along
  the middle of the back, and two indistinct fine lines on each side; below
  the black-outlined white spiracles is a yellow stripe. Head, bluish
  green, freckled with darker green. It feeds on ash in May and June.</p>

  <p>The moth appears on the wing, and may be seen at ivy bloom and sugar,
  from September to November, and is sometimes captured at sallow, after
  hibernation, in March or April.</p>

  <p>It is on record that two specimens taken in November were kept in
  confinement, and three other captives were added in February. All
  continued to live until June, and two were still alive on the 23rd of
  that month.</p>

  <p>Although this species is found more or less regularly in most of the
  English counties south of Worcester on the west, and Huntingdon on the
  east, it is always very local, and never plentiful. It has been reported
  from Carmarthenshire in South Wales; and Kane states that in Ireland it
  has been taken in Galway and Kerry.</p>

<h5><b>The Pale Pinion</b> (<i>Lithophane</i> (<i>Xylina</i>) <i>socia</i>).</h5>

  <p>The pale ochreous-brown insect shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate12">12</a>, Fig. 5, is without the dark, sometimes blackish
  suffusion on the inner area which is characteristic of the type of this
  species. Var. <i>rufescens</i>, Tutt, is a reddish form.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale green with three white lines, the central one
  broad and stripe-like; the line along the spiracles is yellow. Head, pale
  green, variegated with white. (Adapted from Porritt.)</p>

  <p>The moth comes to ivy bloom, sugar, etc., in September and October,
  and even later if the weather is mild. After hibernation it reappears as
  early as February, and visits the sallows as soon as the catkins
  open.</p>

  <p>Although it seems to be absent from the eastern counties, except
  Cambridge&mdash;where, however, it is scarce&mdash;this species is found
  in most of the other counties mentioned for the last species. It is
  generally more plentiful, especially in the west. Occasionally specimens
  have been taken in Cumberland, and single examples have been recorded
  from the Liverpool and Hartlepool districts. It seems to be not uncommon
  in South Wales, and has been reported from Capel Curig, in
  Carnarvonshire. As regards Ireland, Kane says that there are few Irish
  localities where this species is not found.</p>

<h5><b>The Conformist</b> (<i>Graptolitha</i> (<i>Xylina</i>) <i>furcifera</i>).</h5>

  <p>The typical form of this species has the fore wings of a pale slaty
  grey colour; this, however, does not seem to occur in Britain. Our form,
  var. <i>suffusa</i>, Tutt (shown on Plate <a href="#plate13">13</a>,
  Figs. 1 and 2), is much darker grey with blackish mottling, a yellowish
  mark at the base and a reddish cloud in the reniform stigma; the outer
  area is more or less tinged with violet, and this tint sometimes spreads
  over the whole of the fore wings; <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum" title="052.png"
  ><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>the inner margin is tinged with reddish
  orange at the base, or along the basal half, and there are some clouds of
  the same colour on the black submarginal line. This is <i>conformis</i>
  of British authors.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (drawn from a skin, Plate <a href="#plate8">8</a>,
  Fig. 1) is olive brown, tinged with green above, and paler brown, tinged
  with pink beneath; the dots are yellowish in black circles, and there is
  a dark olive-brown mark on ring 1; there are three yellow lines along the
  back, the central one interrupted by darker brown freckles, clustered so
  as to form a series of diamond-shaped patches, and the others are edged
  above with dark olive. It feeds on alder, from April to June.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in September and October, and, after hibernation, in
  March and April. Ivy bloom and sugar attract it in the autumn, and it has
  been taken at sallow catkins as well as at sugar in the spring.</p>

  <p>Since 1861, when its occurrence in Wales was first announced, it has
  been found more or less regularly in Glamorganshire, South Wales, or the
  adjoining English county of Monmouth. The latest record is that by Mr. P.
  J. Barraud, who took a male specimen at sallow bloom in the Wye Valley on
  March 31, 1907. The capture of a specimen at sugar, near Brighton,
  September 13, 1898, has been reported. One specimen has been recorded
  from Yorks., another from Westmoreland; and in 1902, two from near
  Lancaster. Wales, however, appears to be the home of this species in the
  British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>The Nonconformist</b> (<i>Graptolitha</i> (<i>Xylina</i>) <i>lamda</i>).</h5>

  <p>The example of this species shown on Plate <a href="#plate13">13</a>,
  Fig. 3, is of the typical form, and hails from the Continent. Of the six
  specimens observed in England the majority have been recorded as
  <i>zinckenii</i>, Treitschke, a form having the fore wings more
  variegated with white. Another form, ab. <i>somniculosa</i>, Hering, <!--
  Page 31 --><span class="pagenum" title="053.png"><a
  name="page31"></a>{31}</span>has most of the typical markings, especially
  on the outer area, absent.</p>

  <p>The earliest occurrence of this species in Britain appears to have
  been that of a specimen on the trunk of a poplar tree in the northern
  environs of London, October, 1865. Then on September 30, 1866, one was
  detected on the bole of a willow tree in a locality not indicated more
  definitely than "near New Cross"; another specimen was taken in the same
  year in the Guildford district, at sugar. On October 3, 1870, a fourth
  was found on the reverse side of a tree that had been sugared, at
  Dartford, Kent; and a specimen, labelled Erith, September, 1875, was in
  the collection of the late Mr. Bond. Lastly, a specimen came to sugar at
  Copdock, Ipswich, in late September, 1895.</p>

  <p>The range of this species abroad extends through Scandinavia, Belgium,
  North Germany, and North Russia, to East Siberia, and Amurland. It is
  found in North America, where it is known as <i>thaxteri</i>, Grote.</p>

<h5><b>The Grey Shoulder-knot</b> (<i>Graptolitha</i> (<i>Xylina</i>) <i>ornithopus</i>).</h5>

  <p>The moth, of which a portrait will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate12">12</a>, Fig. 6, emerges from the chrysalis in the autumn,
  and may then be found at night on ivy bloom or at the sugar patch; and in
  the daytime it may frequently be seen on tree trunks, palings, etc. After
  hibernation, it is again seen in the spring, on fences, pales, etc., and
  visits the sallow catkins at night. Females of this species, and other
  hibernating kinds, taken in the spring generally deposit fertile eggs
  pretty freely; often such specimens are not in the best condition, but
  one female, if she has not already parted with most of her eggs, will as
  a rule deposit quite as many as the collector is likely to need.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is of a blue-green colour with whitish freckles; <!--
  Page 32 --><span class="pagenum" title="054.png"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>three broken whitish lines along the back;
  head, green, with a paler mark on each cheek. It is to be found in May
  and early June on the leaves of oak.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed throughout England and Wales, but is
  more frequently met with in the south than in the north. It is found in
  Scotland, but only rarely, and the same remark applies to Ireland
  generally, although the species is not uncommon in some parts of Wicklow,
  Cork, and Kerry.</p>

  <p>Its range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Golden-rod Brindle</b> (<i>Lithomoia solidaginis</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate12">12</a>, Fig. 8 represents a Lancashire
  specimen, whilst Fig. 9 is taken from an Aberdeen example. The first,
  having the central area suffused with brown, is more nearly typical, and
  the other varies in the direction of ab. <i>virgata</i>, Tutt, in which
  form the central shade is black. Other named forms are&mdash;ab.
  <i>cinerascens</i>, Staud. = <i>pallida</i>, Tutt (pale ashy-grey,
  central shade almost or quite obsolete), ab. <i>suffusa</i>, Tutt
  (similar to <i>virgata</i>, but the basal area also black or
  blackish).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brown, with a purplish or violet tinge, and
  freckled with grey; an indistinct line along the middle of the back and a
  creamy stripe along the sides, the latter is edged above with black;
  head, shining reddish-brown, freckled with darker brown. It feeds on
  bilberry, bearberry (<i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>), heather, sallow,
  birch, and hawthorn, and is to be found from May to July.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in August and September, and in its woodland and
  moorland haunts is to be seen sitting about on the dead stems of bracken,
  charred twigs and stems of heather, or on birch trunks, rocks, walls,
  etc. When thus resting, however, they very closely resemble twisted birch
  bark, grouse droppings, and other common objects occurring in the haunts
  of the species, so that its detection is not easy at first. <!-- Page 33
  --><span class="pagenum" title="055.png"><a
  name="page33"></a>{33}</span></p>

  <p>In England this species is found from Shropshire and Staffordshire
  northwards to Cumberland; thence through Scotland to Aberdeen and
  Sutherland. In Wales it has been obtained commonly near Rhos in the
  north.</p>

  <p>Abroad its range spreads to Amurland; and it occurs in North America,
  where it is known as <i>germana</i>, Morrison.</p>

<h5><b>The Early Grey</b> (<i>Xylocampa areola</i>).</h5>

  <p>A typical specimen of this widely distributed and, at least in the
  southern half of England, rather common species, is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate12">12</a>, Fig. 7. A dark form has been named ab.
  <i>suffusa</i>, Tutt, and one with the fore wings of the typical grey
  colour, but with a pinkish flush, is ab. <i>rosea</i>, Tutt.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (figured from a skin, on Plate <a
  href="#plate8">8</a>, Fig. 2) is yellowish-brown, with a fine pale
  central line along the back, often only distinct on rings 1, 11, and 12,
  and always obscured by dark brown patches on 7 and 8; a blackish line low
  down along the sides. The body tapers towards each end, and especially so
  towards the small head. It lives upon honey-suckle, and feeds on the
  leaves at night, during May and June, or sometimes later.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:19%;">
      <a href="images/fig01.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig01.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 1." title="Fig. 1." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center"><span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Early Grey at rest.</b></p>

    <p style="text-align:center">(Photo by W. J. Lucas.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The moth appears in March and April, and, in the daytime, is often met
  with at rest on posts, fences, and the trunks of trees; also upon stone
  walls, but seemingly less frequently, probably owing to the moth being
  then less easy to detect. At night it flies around sallow bushes and
  sometimes settles on the catkins, but is always on the alert. <!-- Page
  34 --><span class="pagenum" title="056.png"><a
  name="page34"></a>{34}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Sword-grass</b> (<i>Calocampa exoleta</i>).</h5>

  <p>Except that the pale grey brown fore wings are more clouded with
  blackish in some specimens than in others, there is little of importance
  to note. Usually there are two black wedges pointing inwards from the
  indistinct submarginal line, but occasionally one, or more rarely both,
  may be absent. (Plate <a href="#plate14">14</a>, Figs. 3 &#x2642; and 4
  &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with two series of white spotted black
  marks, the line below these is yellow, and that lower down on the side is
  bright red; the spots between the lines are white, encircled with black.
  From April to May it feeds, often in the sunshine, as well as at night,
  on restharrow, thistles, stonecrop, groundsel, dock, in fact on almost
  all low-growing plants, as well as the foliage of some trees. The
  caterpillars of this and the next species are exceedingly pretty
  creatures, and are sure to attract attention whenever met with. Dr.
  Chapman notes that the caterpillar will feed on stale leaves.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in the autumn, and seems to be on the wing until
  quite late in the year, and is seen again as early as March, and thence
  on until May. One male and two females captured at sugar, March 12 and
  13, were placed in a glass cylinder with various food plants, and a sprig
  of sallow catkins, moistened occasionally with syrup, afforded
  nourishment for the moths every evening. On April 13, two batches of eggs
  were noted on nettle, but these were not fertile. On April 15 and 20
  pairing took place; and by May 3 over three thousand eggs had been
  deposited. On May 13 the two females, being still alive, were set at
  liberty (Goodwin).</p>

  <p>Although it certainly appears to be less frequently seen in the south
  than northwards, the species is known to occur pretty well all over
  England and Wales. In Scotland, where it is generally commoner than in
  England, except perhaps in the <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum" title="057.png"
  ><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span>northern counties of the latter, its
  range extends to the Orkneys.</p>

  <p>Abroad, it is found throughout Europe (except the most northern
  parts); Asia to Japan; and the Canaries.</p>

<h5><b>The Red Sword-grass</b> (<i>Calocampa vetusta</i>).</h5>

  <p>In this species the ground colour of the fore wings varies from whity
  brown to ochreous brown with a slight reddish tinge. A greyish shade
  spreads from the base along the median vein to below the reniform stigma
  in the paler and more typical specimens; the inner area is dark brown,
  but widely broken below the reniform by the grey suffusion. The specimens
  figured on Plate <a href="#plate14">14</a> (Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;)
  are from Sligo, Ireland, and are referable to var. <i>brunnea</i>, Tutt.
  The inner area in this form is red-brown, or inclining to blackish
  brown.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with three yellow lines along the back, and
  a reddish orange stripe along the area of the spiracles; a series of
  black-circled white dots on each side of the central line; in the form
  figured (from a skin) on Plate <a href="#plate8">8</a>, Fig. 3, the lines
  on the back are white, and the spaces between them black, dotted with
  white; the stripe along the reddish spiracles also white, edged above
  with black; head, shining light reddish brown. It feeds, from May to
  July, on various low herbage, such as dock, persicaria, knotgrass, etc.,
  also sedges and yellow flag.</p>

  <p>The moth appears in September and October, and again in March and
  April, but seems to have been noted at various times both earlier and
  later. Mathew records that a female captured at sugar on June 11,
  deposited 36 eggs during the following week. These were laid in a chip
  box, and the caterpillars hatched out on June 24, fed up quickly on
  knotgrass, attained full growth by July 24, and pupated about that date.
  <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum" title="058.png"><a
  name="page36"></a>{36}</span>One moth emerged September 29, and five
  others, including three cripples, later.</p>

  <p>This species is most frequent in Ireland and Scotland, being
  distributed throughout the latter country to Orkney and Shetland. It has
  been noted from almost every part of England, but does not seem to be
  plentiful generally in the country.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad ranges to East Siberia and to North
  America.</p>

<h5><b>The Mullein</b> (<i>Cucullia verbasci</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two specimens, representing both sexes, of this species are shown on
  Plate <a href="#plate15">15</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;. Sometimes
  the darker colour on the marginal areas, especially the inner, inclines
  to blackish; while in some specimens the whole of the fore wings is
  suffused with brownish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is white with a greenish tinge, each ring of the body
  is banded with yellow, has four black spots on the back, and some black
  dots and lines on the sides; the head is yellowish, dotted with black. It
  may be found in June and July quite exposed on mullein (<i>Verbascum
  thapsus</i>, and <i>V. pulverulentum</i>); also figwort (<i>Scrophularia
  nodosa</i>, and <i>S. aquatica</i>). Barrett states that it has been
  noted on <i>Buddlæa globosa</i>, an American plant sometimes grown in
  gardens. These caterpillars are certainly attacked by parasitical flies,
  but do not seem to be quite so frequently "stung" as those of some other
  species of the "Sharks." The caterpillar figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate18">18</a>, Fig. 1, was obtained at Box Hill by Mr. Norman
  Riley.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in late April and in May, and, except an occasional
  capture at light, is rarely seen in the open. The caterpillars are
  probably obtainable in most English and Welsh counties, especially the
  southern ones of both countries, wherever there is an abundance of its
  food plants. Except that McArthur found the species in the Isle of Lewis,
  in 1901, there is no record from Scotland. In Ireland it has been
  recorded from Dublin by Birchall; and in 1901 three moths were taken at
  Timoleague, Co. Cork, and caterpillars later on were plentiful in the
  district.</p>

<h5><b>The Water Betony</b> (<i>Cucullia scrophulariæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>A good deal of confusion exists both in Britain and on the Continent
  as to the identity of the <i>Cucullia</i> figured and described by
  Capieux in 1789, and by most authors since that time. I have received
  over twenty specimens from Austria, Germany, and other parts of Europe,
  sent to me as <i>scrophulariæ</i>. As I have been unable to separate the
  majority of these specimens from <i>C. lychnitis</i>, and the others from
  <i>C. verbasci</i>, Mr. F. N. Pierce has been good enough to examine the
  genitalia of six of the males, and of these he reports four are <i>C.
  lychnitis</i>, and two are <i>C. verbasci</i>.</p>

  <p>In England we certainly have a <i>Cucullia</i> sometimes appearing in
  the moth state rather later than <i>C. verbasci</i> and always earlier
  than <i>C. lychnitis;</i> the caterpillar producing it feeds on
  <i>Scrophularia nodosa</i> in July. It is, however, very local, and is
  found chiefly in North Kent, and occasionally in the Eastern Counties.
  Mr. Pierce finds that the male genitalia of a North Kent
  <i>scrophulariæ</i> sent to him do not differ from these parts in <i>C.
  verbasci</i>, but Dr. Chapman informs me that he detects a slight
  difference in one that he examined.</p>

  <p>It must be admitted that the identity of the North Kent and East
  Anglian <i>Cucullia</i> with the <i>scrophulariæ</i> of Capieux is very
  doubtful, but we evidently shall not be greatly opposed to Continental
  methods if we continue to allow April and May moths resulting from
  Scrophularia nodosa caterpillars to do duty for <i>C. scrophulariæ</i>. I
  have therefore figured as this species a specimen that was reared, with
  others, in April and May, 1877, from larvæ obtained in the Dartford
  marshes. (Plate <a href="#plate15">15</a>, Fig. 3.) <!-- Page 38 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="062.png"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is of a whitish-grey colour; along the middle of the
  back is a series of broad deep yellow triangles pointing backwards, each
  edged on both sides by large confluent deep black spots, usually forming
  a somewhat C-shaped marking, which encloses another yellow spot, and
  below is followed by several black spots; behind all these, on each
  segment, is a deep green transverse spotless band. The forms of the black
  markings, composed of united spots, vary in the degree of union of these
  spots; each anterior spot is confluent with the posterior one below it,
  but does not unite transversely with the others; in one variety they
  resemble tadpole forms united by the tails, in another these tails are as
  thick as the spots and form blotched curves; and in still another they
  are so thick and confluent as to include some of the side spots, thus
  completely edging two sides of the yellow triangle with a blotched black
  border. (Adapted from Buckler.)</p>

<h5><b>The Striped Lychnis</b> (<i>Cucullia lychnitis</i>).</h5>

  <p>An example of each sex of this species is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate15">15</a>, Figs. 4 and 5. The general colour of the fore
  wings is paler, and the streaks along the front and inner margins are
  darker than in <i>C. verbasci</i>; and the outer margins of the wings are
  less jagged.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (figured on Plate <a href="#plate18">18</a>, Fig. 2,
  from a photo by Mr. H. Main) is greenish white or yellow; the rings are
  cross banded with yellow and spotted with black; usually the spots are
  united as in the figure, sometimes they are smaller and well separated,
  and occasionally all but those low down along the sides are absent.
  Coupled with decrease in size and number of the black spots, there is
  variation in the width of the yellow bands. <i>Verbascum nigrum</i> is
  the more usual food plant in Britain, but it will also eat <i>V.
  lychnitis</i>. It feeds, in July and August, on the flowers and unripe
  seed capsules in preference to the foliage. <!-- Page 39 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="063.png"><a name="page39"></a>{39}</span></p>

  <p>Between sixty and seventy years ago, the late Mr. Samuel Stevens
  obtained the caterpillars on mullein growing in a chalk pit at Arundel in
  Sussex, and this seems to be the earliest notice of the species occurring
  in Britain. It is now known also to inhabit Hampshire, Surrey, and
  Oxfordshire; has been reported from Norfolk, Suffolk, and
  Gloucestershire.</p>

<h5><b>The Star-wort</b> (<i>Cucullia asteris</i>).</h5>

  <p>The silvery-grey fore wings of this moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate15">15</a>, Fig. 6) are broadly suffused with reddish brown
  along the front margin, and more narrowly with purplish brown inclining
  to blackish along the inner margin; the latter is separated from a
  purplish brown blotch at the outer angle by a whitish edged black curved
  mark.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (figured on Plate <a href="#plate18">18</a>, Fig. 3,
  from a photo by Mr. Main) is green with a black-edged yellow stripe along
  the back, and another along the white spiracles; between these stripes
  are two pale greenish lines; head, green, sprinkled with blackish. In
  another form the body is suffused with reddish, inclining to purplish on
  the back; yellow markings pretty much as in the green form. It feeds
  chiefly on golden-rod (<i>Solidago virgaurea</i>) and sea star-wort
  (<i>Aster tripolium</i>), showing a decided preference for the flowers,
  but will eat the foliage of the plants mentioned. In confinement it can
  be reared on garden asters and Michaelmas daisy. It may be obtained on
  its food plants from July well into September.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges in June and July as a rule, sometimes in early
  August, but has been known to come from the chrysalis during September up
  to the 23rd of that month. The species is found often abundantly in the
  caterpillar state in the seaboard counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex,
  Kent, Sussex, Hants, and Dorset. In Surrey it has occurred at Haslemere,
  and in <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum" title="064.png"><a
  name="page40"></a>{40}</span>the Croydon district (?); and it has been
  recorded from Herefordshire and North Lancashire.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to East Siberia, Amurland, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Shark</b> (<i>Cucullia umbratica</i>).</h5>

  <p>On the fore wings of this greyish species (Plate <a
  href="#plate16">16</a>, Figs. 5 &#x2642; and 6 &#x2640;) there is some
  variation in the short black streaks on the basal and outer areas, and in
  the dots around the stigma; the front margin is sometimes brownish
  tinged. The hind wings of the female are always darker than those of the
  male.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds on plants of the sowthistle (<i>Sonchus</i>)
  kind, also on garden lettuce and the wild species. It may be found in
  August and early September, but, as it feeds only at night, it should be
  searched for in the daytime on the undersides of the lower leaves. In
  general colour it is ochreous inclining to greyish, with an intricate
  raised pattern in blackish on the upper surface; the head is black, and
  there is a yellow spotted sooty brown plate on the first ring of the
  body.</p>

  <p>The moth is to be seen in June and July, sitting on the upper parts of
  palings, and other kinds of wooden fencing; also on tent pegs, etc.; but
  it is not easy to detect even when its whereabouts is indicated. At night
  it visits flowers of campion, sweet william, honeysuckle, etc.</p>

  <p>Widely distributed throughout the British Isles to the Orkneys, but
  seemingly more plentiful and regular in occurrence in the south of
  England than in the north.</p>

<h5><b>The Chamomile Shark</b> (<i>Cucullia chamomillæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>Although somewhat similar to the last species, this moth may be
  distinguished by the more brownish tinge of its grey fore wings. The hind
  wings are also brown-grey in both sexes, but darkest in the female. <!--
  Page 41 --><span class="pagenum" title="065.png"><a
  name="page41"></a>{41}</span></p>

  <p>Sometimes the central area of the fore wings is clouded with blackish
  from the front to the inner margin; such specimens are referable to ab.
  <i>chrysanthemi</i>, Hübn. (Plate <a href="#plate16">16</a>, Figs. 1
  typical, 2 ab.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which may be found in the summer months, is greenish
  white with zigzag olive markings, the lines on the back meeting in the
  middle of each ring, where there is a small pinkish blotch; head, pale
  yellowish, striped with brown on the face. It feeds on wild chamomile
  (<i>Matricaria</i>), stinking mayweed (<i>Anthemis</i>), and
  <i>Pyrethrum</i> (Plate <a href="#plate18">18</a>, Fig. 1). The Rev.
  Miles Moss, writing his experience of this species at Rossall, near
  Fleetwood, Lancashire, notes that until half-grown the caterpillars live
  exposed, and are then found lying in a half-circle on the crowns of
  unexpanded flower heads. At this time they are green with dark and also
  white markings. He adds that caterpillars measuring about an inch in
  length when collected, were preparing for pupation a week later.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in April and May, and has been captured even in July.
  When chrysalids are kept indoors, but not dry, the moths sometimes emerge
  in March, and occasionally in the earlier months of the year. A habit
  more or less general among the species of this genus is to remain in the
  chrysalis state for two or more winters; the present species has been
  known to emerge during March of the first, second, and third years
  following that in which the caterpillars were found.</p>

  <p>Widely distributed over England and Wales, but apparently most
  frequent in the seaboard counties. In Scotland it occurs up to
  Perthshire, and it is found on various parts of the Irish coast.</p>

<h5><b>The Cudweed</b> (<i>Cucullia gnaphalii</i>).</h5>

  <p>Portraits of two specimens of this very local species, kindly lent by
  Mr. R. Adkin, will be found on Plate <a href="#plate13">13</a>, Figs. 4
  and 5. <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum" title="066.png"><a
  name="page42"></a>{42}</span>The general coloration is usually silvery
  grey, but occasionally it inclines to yellowish. The moth has rarely been
  noted by day, and only one specimen seems to have been captured on the
  wing. Even caterpillars are by no means common in their best-known
  localities, and of those obtained after much labour a large proportion
  may frequently prove to have been the victims of parasitic flies.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, inclining to olive green, thickly freckled
  with pale yellow atoms; a purplish-brown stripe along the middle of the
  back and two faint purplish lines along the sides; a pale yellow line
  along the region of the black-edged spiracles, which are set in
  purplish-brown blotches. (Adapted from Buckler.)</p>

  <p>Its food plant is golden-rod (<i>Solidago</i>) and it feeds at night
  and hides by day, low down on the stems or under the leaves: July to
  September. In confinement the caterpillars will eat garden aster and
  Michaelmas daisy.</p>

  <p>The British haunts of the species are chiefly in Kent (Sevenoaks,
  Tunbridge Wells, etc.), and Sussex (Tilgate Forest, etc.); but according
  to Barrett it is also known from Hampshire, Surrey, and Essex. Abroad,
  the range extends through Central Europe to Southern Scandinavia,
  Livonia, Southern Russia, the Altai Mountains, Italy, and Armenia; but
  the species is nowhere plentiful.</p>

  <p>It may be mentioned here that a very closely allied, and on the
  Continent common, species&mdash;<i>C. xeranthemi</i>,
  Boisduval&mdash;might easily be mistaken for <i>C. gnaphalii</i>.</p>

<h5><b>The Wormwood</b> (<i>Cucullia absinthii</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth is shown on Plate <a href="#plate16">16</a>, Fig. 4. The
  fore wings are usually tinged with purplish over the greyish ground
  colour; black dots on the stigmata give to each of these marks some
  resemblance to the figure 8. <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum" title="067.png"
  ><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds on the flowers and seeds of wormwood
  (<i>Artemisia absinthium</i>) and will eat mugwort (<i>A. vulgaris</i>),
  is best found on sunny days. It is yellowish green, suffused with
  purplish grey on the back of each ring; there are three pale green lines
  along the back, and an ochreous grey plate on ring 1. To be found in
  August and early September, but on dull days it must be sought for among
  the lower leaves, or on the ground. When resting among the flowers it so
  closely harmonises with them that it might easily escape detection.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July.</p>

  <p>The species is perhaps most abundant on the South Devonshire coast,
  but its range extends into Cornwall, and eastward to the Isle of Portland
  and the Isle of Wight; it is not uncommon along the coasts of North Devon
  (Lee and Croyde), Somerset (Minehead), and South Wales. It has also been
  recorded from North Wales, and from parts of the Suffolk coast. In
  Ireland, a specimen was taken in a garden at Cromlyn, Westmeath, in 1873,
  and more recently two specimens of the moth, and also some caterpillars,
  were obtained at Timoleague, Cork.</p>

<h5><i>Cucullia artemisiæ (abrotani)</i>.</h5>

  <p>This species, of which a Continental example is represented on Plate
  <a href="#plate16">16</a>, Fig. 3, is apparently exceedingly rare in this
  country, and most probably is not a native.</p>

  <p>In the collection of the late Dr. Mason, which was dispersed at
  Stevens' in 1905, there were three specimens, each of which had seemingly
  been included among series of <i>C. absinthii</i> purchased at three
  separate sales. A fourth specimen, also mixed with <i>C. absinthii</i>,
  was in the collection of the late Rev. H. Burney. Two other specimens
  have been reported from Devonshire, where, it is said, they were found
  sitting on a fence. <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum" title="068.png"
  ><a name="page44"></a>{44}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds, in August and September, on wormwood and other
  kinds of <i>Artemisia</i>. It is green with red raised spots, a white
  line along the middle of the back, and a yellow stripe low down along the
  sides; head, brown inclining to blackish above. The moth is out in June
  and July.</p>

<h5><b>The Beautiful Yellow Underwing</b> (<i>Anarta myrtilli</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form (Plate <a href="#plate17">17</a>, Figs. 1, 2) this
  species has the fore wings purplish brown or blackish brown, whilst in
  var. <i>rufescens</i>, Tutt, the general colour of the fore wings is
  reddish inclining to crimson, and the white markings are clearly defined.
  In some dark specimens the markings are more or less obscure, and in
  others only the central white dot is distinct.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, dotted and marked with white; there are
  three rows of yellowish bars along the back, those forming the outer
  series slightly curved. It is to be found on ling (<i>Calluna
  vulgaris</i>), also on heath (<i>Erica</i>), from July to October, but it
  seems to be more frequently obtained in early autumn. Occasionally it has
  been found in the spring. Hawthorn has been mentioned as a food-plant
  (Plate <a href="#plate20">20</a>, Fig. 1).</p>

  <p>The moth has been taken in each month from April to August, but it is
  perhaps most plentiful from May to July. The species occurs on heath and
  moorlands throughout the British Isles, but so far it has not been
  recorded from the Shetlands. It flies on sunny days and is very active on
  the wing, but when the sun is obscured, or towards evening, it may be
  found at rest on the heather sprays, usually at their tips.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Dark Yellow Underwing</b> (<i>Anarta cordigera</i>).</h5>

  <p>The pretty moth represented on Plate <a href="#plate17">17</a>, Fig.
  7, is only found in the British Isles, on the mountains of Scotland,
  chiefly in Perthshire and Aberdeenshire. Sometimes the basal area of the
  fore wings is suffused with black, and to a lesser extent the outer area
  also (var. <i>æthiops</i>, Hoffm. = <i>suffusa</i>, Tutt); on the other
  hand, typical examples have both basal and outer areas silvery grey, and
  the central area black. A form, which I have not seen, is described as
  having the black central area broken by an ashy cross band passing
  between the stigmata (var. <i>variegata</i>, Tutt).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is reddish brown, with three white lines along the
  back, and a reddish-freckled ochreous stripe low down on the sides.
  Sometimes the general colour is blackish. It feeds on bearberry
  (<i>Arctostaphylos</i>) in June and July; also said to eat <i>Vaccinium
  uliginosum</i>; in confinement it will thrive on <i>Arbutus unedo</i>,
  commonly known as the "strawberry tree."</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May, when it flies in the sunshine, and in dull
  weather sits about on the rocks, stones, lichen, etc. Mr. Cockayne notes
  that at Rannoch he met with it from May 17 in numbers, but always in
  isolated spots where bearberry was plentiful. Here the moths were either
  feeding on the flowers or settled on the ground. He further remarks that
  this species occurs at the comparatively low elevation of 800 to 900
  feet, whereas the next species ascends to 2000 feet.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad extends to Amurland and Labrador.</p>

<h5><b>The Broad-bordered White Underwing</b> (<i>Anarta melanopa</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species has the ground colour of the fore wings greyish in the
  type and brownish in var. <i>wiströmi</i>, Lampa. Specimens with the fore
  wings more or less typical, but with the normally white area of hind
  wings dark greyish, are referable to ab. <i>rupestralis.</i> I remember
  seeing a specimen of the last-named form in the collection of the late
  Mr. S. Stevens, but I believe that it is very rare in the British Isles.
  In all forms there is variation in the stigmata, and in the orbicular
  especially. (Plate <a href="#plate17">17</a>, Figs. 5 &#x2642; and 6
  &#x2640;.) <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum" title="072.png"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is of a purplish pink colour, with a black-edged
  ochreous-brown line along the middle of the back, broken up by
  reddish-brown triangles; the stripe along the region of the black
  spiracles is yellowish white flecked with red; the sides of the body
  above the stripe are flecked with reddish, and above them is a
  yellowish-white line and some black marks. Head, brownish, freckled with
  darker. It feeds at night, in July, on bilberry (<i>Vaccinium
  myrtillus</i>), cowberry (<i>V. vitis-idæa</i>), and can also be reared
  on strawberry tree, sallow, knotgrass, etc. In the daytime it must be
  searched for under the leaves.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and the early part of June, and is most active
  in the sunshine, but flies on dull days when the weather is warm. It
  seems confined to the higher level of the mountains, and its habits are
  similar to those of the last species, but its range extends to the
  Shetland Isles. The species was not recognised as British until about
  1830, and the same remark applies to <i>A. cordigera.</i></p>

<h5><b>The Small Yellow Underwing</b> (<i>Heliaca tenebrata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are a little more reddish in some specimens than in
  others, and occasionally the yellow of the hind wings is much reduced in
  area by the expansion of the black border, or it may be suffused with
  blackish. (Plate <a href="#plate17">17</a>, Figs. 3 and 4.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with three lines along the back, the central
  one dark green and the others whitish, bordered below with dark green;
  the stripe low down along the sides is yellowish white, edged above with
  dark green. It feeds, in June and July, on mouse-ear chickweed
  (<i>Cerastium</i>), devouring the blossom and seeds, when young boring
  into the unripe capsule.</p>

  <p>The moth flies on sunny days in May and early June, and is more or
  less common in grass-bordered lanes, hay meadows, etc., in most counties
  throughout the southern part of England. <!-- Page 47 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="073.png"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>In the
  midland counties it appears to be far more local, thence to Durham (its
  northern limit in England) it is generally scarce. It has been recorded
  from Pembrokeshire and Flintshire, in Wales. A specimen has been reported
  from Robroyston, near Glasgow, in Scotland. As the species has been
  obtained in Kerry and Sligo, the probability is that it occurs in other
  parts of Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Pease-blossom</b> (<i>Chariclea delphinii</i>).</h5>

  <p>The beautifully tinted moth represented by Figs. 8 and 9 on Plate <a
  href="#plate17">17</a> was known as British to Haworth (1802), but it had
  been figured by Wilkes in 1773, and by Moses Harris in 1775. In 1829
  Stephens remarked that there were then but few native specimens in
  British cabinets, among which were examples from the Windsor district
  "caught about fifteen years since, in June." He adds, the interest and
  value of these, and older specimens, was lessened by "the execrable
  practice of introducing Continental insects into collections." Stainton
  (1857) refers to the Windsor specimens only, and Newman (1869) ignores
  the species altogether. In 1902 two specimens were presented to the
  British Museum by Mr. J. F. Bennett, and are now in the National
  Collection of British Lepidoptera. These were obtained at Brighton in
  1876 by the donor's father, but whether captured or reared is not
  known.</p>

<h5><b>The Bordered Sallow</b> (<i>Pyrrhia umbra</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate17">17</a>, Figs.
  10, 11) in its typical form are yellow inclining to orange, with the
  outer area more or less tinted with purplish. In a paler form, ab.
  <i>marginata</i>, Fab., the fore wings are without the orange tint, and
  the outer area is rather greyish brown. <!-- Page 48 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="074.png"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate20">20</a>, Fig. 4) is grey or
  greenish, speckled with white, and with raised black dots; there are
  three lines along the back, the central one white edged, broader and
  darker than the outer ones, which are sometimes white; a white-edged pale
  yellow stripe low down along the sides. In some examples the general
  colour is pinkish brown.</p>

  <p>It feeds on restharrow (<i>Ononis</i>) in July and August, but can be
  reared on knotgrass, and has been known to thrive on the green pods of
  the scarlet runner bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>). The moth flies at
  dusk in June, sometimes earlier or later. It visits the flowers of
  various plants, especially those of <i>Silene</i> and <i>Lychnis</i>;
  also comes to the sugar patch and may be attracted by light. Although not
  generally common, it seems to be widely distributed over England and
  Wales, but is most frequent in the seaboard counties, and this is more
  particularly the case in the north. In Scotland it appears to occur from
  Berwick northwards to Moray, and in Ireland it has been noted from
  several of the littoral counties, chiefly southern, but also from
  Sligo.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to the North-west Himalayas, Amurland, Corea,
  and Japan; the species also occurs in North America from the Atlantic to
  the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<h5><b>The Marbled Clover</b> (<i>Heliothis dipsacea</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour of this species (Plate <a href="#plate19">19</a>,
  Figs. 1, 2) ranges from yellowish to ochreous with a greyish, or olive,
  tinge; the central band including the reniform stigma is olive, or
  reddish brown, terminating on the inner margin in a cloud extending
  towards the hind margin; submarginal line preceded by a shade-like band
  similar in colour to the central one, but often only well defined on
  costal and inner margins; the whitish area of the hind wings is sometimes
  much reduced. The darker specimens are typical of the species, whilst
  those with the paler ground colour and brighter cross bands are referable
  to var. <i>maritima</i>, Grasl.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar varies in colour, green of various shades, pinkish, or
  purplish brown; three lines along the back, the central one with dark
  edges, and the outer ones whitish, with dark lower edge; the line low
  down along the sides is often whitish; but this, and also the other white
  lines, may be replaced by greenish or yellowish. It feeds on various
  low-growing plants such as restharrow, scabious, toadflax, white campion,
  bladder campion, clover, etc., preferring the flowers and seeds. It has
  been found from July to September. Sometimes it has been reared on the
  pods of the scarlet-runner bean.</p>

  <p>The moth, which is out in June and July, dashes about rapidly in the
  daytime, and as it is partial to the flowers of the bugloss, or those of
  clover, etc., it may be netted when feasting on the blossoms. It occurs
  in meadows, on heaths, and on sandhills by the sea, in most of the
  southern and eastern counties of England, but is only rarely seen
  northwards, and has not been recorded from other parts of the British
  Isles.</p>

  <p>Distribution abroad: the whole Palæarctic region less the extreme
  north; also represented in North America by <i>phlogophagus</i>, Grote
  and Robinson.</p>

<h5><b>The Spotted Clover Moth</b> (<i>Heliothis scutosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>The very distinct-looking moth shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate19">19</a>, Fig. 3, is exceedingly rare in Britain, only
  about eleven specimens being authenticated. The earliest-known British
  specimen was captured in a locality near Dalston, in Cumberland, July,
  1835. The next record is of three examples near Skinburnness, also in
  Cumberland. Then, in 1875, one occurred in Norfolk, at the Cromer
  lighthouse, and this was followed by another in 1876. In 1877 one was
  captured as it flew over clover at Weston-super-Mare. On September 19,
  1878, a specimen was netted at <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum" title="078.png"
  ><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span>the flowers of ragwort on the shore of
  Lough Swilly, near Buncrana, Ireland, and one is recorded as taken near
  Aberdeen, Scotland, in July of that year. The late Dr. Mason had a
  specimen said to have been taken at Attleborough, in Norfolk, June, 1880.
  The latest recorded capture is that of a specimen taken by Mr. F. Capel
  Hanbury in a clover field near Dartmouth, South Devon, September 4,
  1900.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends through Central and Southern Europe eastward
  to North India, North China; and southwards to North-west Africa. It
  occurs also in the Western United States of America.</p>

<h5><b>The Bordered Straw</b> (<i>Heliothis peltigera</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two examples of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate19">19</a>, Figs. 4, 5. The fore wings are pale ochreous
  brown, with a more or less reddish tinge; the cross lines are not always
  distinct, but there is generally a dark dot on the costal end of the
  first line, and a large olive-brown spot between the second and
  submarginal lines; following the submarginal line is a pale band of
  variable width, but always with a black dot (sometimes double) towards
  its lower end. Very pale specimens are referable to ab. <i>pallida</i>,
  Cockerell.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate20">20</a>, Fig. 3, figured from
  a coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich) is green, with three darker green or
  reddish stripes along the back; the stripe along the area of the
  spiracles is dark green, edged below with white, but when the other
  stripes are reddish this is also marked with that colour. Several other
  forms have been described, and the caterpillar seems to be a most
  variable one. It feeds, from June to August, and again in September and
  October, on many kinds of low-growing herbage, such as restharrow
  (<i>Ononis</i>), clover (<i>Trifolium</i>), <i>Matricaria inodora</i>,
  etc.; also on furze or gorse (<i>Ulex</i>), and thorn apple
  (<i>Datura</i>). The blossoms and unripe <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="079.png"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>seeds are
  preferred in almost all cases, and flowers of the garden marigold will be
  found useful when these caterpillars are reared in confinement.</p>

  <p>From eggs deposited by a female moth taken at Deal in the evening of
  June 17, 1904, the caterpillars hatched out in due course, fed up on wild
  convolvulus, pupated at the end of July, and the moths emerged during the
  last week of August and the first week of September. In another case,
  moths were developed in about forty-seven days from eggs laid in
  mid-July. In 1907 six caterpillars were found in South Devon during the
  second week in August, and one of these attained the moth state on
  September 3. Previous to 1906, which was a notable one for the species,
  the moth seems not to have been observed earlier than June, but in the
  year mentioned several were taken at the flowers of valerian during May,
  at Torquay. Caterpillars were plentiful on restharrow in the same
  district during June and July, and an example, presumably, of a second
  generation was captured at bramble blossom on August 11. In the same year
  and on the 15th of the month just noted, a specimen was reared from a
  caterpillar found on <i>Ononis</i>, July 18, and another specimen
  captured, August 24, as it flew in the sunshine on a slope of the South
  Downs. In Clarendon Wood, near Salisbury, Wilts, one example was taken at
  sugar, September 2, 1906. The species seems to be of fairly regular
  occurrence in Devonshire and Cornwall, but it has also been observed,
  more or less rarely, in many other English counties, chiefly those on the
  coast; in Pembrokeshire and Glamorganshire, South Wales; a few specimens
  have occurred in Co. Cork, and one in Co. Wicklow, Ireland. All that
  appears to be known of this species in Scotland is that one specimen has
  been recorded from Markton, Ayrshire.</p>

  <p>Abroad, its distribution is extensive, ranging from Africa, the
  Canaries, and Madeira to Central and Southern Europe, and through Asia to
  India. <!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum" title="080.png"><a
  name="page52"></a>{52}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Scarce Bordered Straw</b> (<i>Heliothis armigera</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate19">19</a>, Figs. 6-8) has an
  almost universal distribution. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa,
  America, and Australia. As regards the British Isles, it was first
  recorded by Mr. Edleston, who noted a specimen taken at Salford,
  Lancashire, by Mr. John Thomas, in September, 1840. This specimen, also
  one captured at Mickleham, Surrey, and others "taken in various
  localities," are referred to in the <i>Entomologist's Annual</i> for
  1855. The following year one was reported from Exeter and one from the
  Isle of Wight. The summer of 1859 was a hot one (as were the two previous
  summers), and the species was recorded from the following localities:
  Brighton, Bristol, Cambridge, Edmonton, Isle of Wight, Ramsgate, Torquay,
  Weston-super-Mare, Worthing, and other places. Apart from the captures on
  the Devonshire coast, chiefly at Torquay, where the moth seems to occur
  pretty nearly every year, the records since 1859 are: 1866 (Scarborough);
  1871 (Wakefield); 1876 (Hartlepool, and Kentish Coast); 1877 and 1881
  (Gloucester); 1890 (Chatham); 1895 (Tunbridge Wells); 1901 (Isle of
  Wight); 1902 (Chester and Harwich); 1903 (Lewes). In all cases only
  single specimens. The species has been noted once in South Wales, and
  twice in North Wales; several specimens were secured in 1898 near
  Berwick-on-Tweed, and odd specimens have been recorded from Ireland.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is variable in colour; in one form it is green with a
  yellowish stripe along the sides, and in another the colour is purplish
  brown. The form figured (Plate <a href="#plate20">20</a>, Fig. 2) is
  pinkish brown with a black-edged whitish line along the back, and a
  pinkish freckled and brownish edged yellowish stripe along the sides; the
  raised dots are white as a rule, but sometimes in the darker forms they
  are blackish. In some examples of the green form the dots and lines are
  black. <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum" title="081.png"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span></p>

  <p>In 1869 two specimens of the moth were reared from caterpillars
  imported with tomatoes from Spain; twenty-three years later Mr. Arkle
  referred to the arrival here of <i>H. armigera</i> in the larval state
  with consignments of tomatoes, from Valencia, landed at Liverpool in the
  months of June and July. The late Mr. Tugwell reared larvæ, from eggs
  deposited by a captured female moth, on scarlet geranium; and there is a
  record of the finding of caterpillars on such plants, in the autumn of
  1876, in the Isle of Wight. Specimens of the moth found at large in
  Britain occur in the autumn.</p>

  <p>In the United States of America, where it is known as the "Cotton Boll
  worm," "Corn-ear worm," and "Tomato fruit worm," this caterpillar is
  chiefly destructive to corn crops, as of the five generations stated to
  occur during the year in the States three occur in cornfields. It also
  attacks beans, tobacco, pumpkins, melons, oranges, garden
  flowering-plants, and many kinds of wild plants. The British nurserymen
  and farmers are perhaps to be congratulated on the fact that this moth is
  only an accidental visitor and not a native.</p>

<h5><b>The Pale Shoulder</b> (<i>Acontia</i> (<i>Tarache</i>) <i>lucida</i>, var. <i>albicollis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Only eight specimens of this species seem to have been noted in
  Britain, and all these are apparently referable to the summer form, var.
  <i>albicollis</i>, Fabricius. (Plate <a href="#plate19">19</a>, Fig. 9.)
  Stephens, who figured it as <i>solaris</i>, Wien Verz. (Haustellata iii.,
  Plate 29, Fig. 3), states that the specimen was in Marsham's collection,
  but that nothing farther was known about it. He, however, mentions two
  other specimens "taken within the Metropolitan area about ten years ago
  [that would be 1820] and four others near Dover above six years ago."
  Dale fixes the date of Dover captures as June, 1825. On August 25, 1859,
  a specimen was taken in a clover field at Brighton. <!-- Page 54 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="082.png"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span></p>

  <p>The species has an extensive range abroad, being found in Southern
  Europe and North-west Africa to Madeira and the Canaries; also in Central
  Europe, through Western and Central Asia to North India and East
  Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>The Four-spotted</b> (<i>Acontia</i> (<i>Tarache</i>) <i>luctuosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate19">19</a>, Fig.
  10) are sometimes finely powdered with white, but more often the outer
  marginal area is distinctly flecked with white. The conspicuous central
  spot is usually white, but occasionally it has a pinkish ochreous tinge;
  very rarely it is reduced to a narrow streak with a short spur from its
  outer edge. The white band on the hind wings is sometimes narrowed and
  contracted below the middle.</p>

  <p>The eggs are shown on Plate <a href="#plate23">23</a>, Fig. 2. They
  were, when laid on June 17, whity brown marked with reddish brown.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous greyish inclining to reddish or brownish;
  three dark-edged stripes along the back, a dark-brown line along the
  black spiracles, with two finer wavy lines above it; lower down there is
  a broad stripe of reddish brown; head marked with four lines of black
  dots. It feeds, at night, during June, July, and August (later in some
  seasons), on the small bindweed (<i>Convolvulus arvensis</i>), and
  although it will eat the leaves when nearly full grown it prefers the
  flowers and seeds in its infancy.</p>

  <p>The moth appears in May and June, and a second generation in August
  and September. In the sunshine it is active on the wing, but in dull
  weather it hides under herbage, in clover fields, chalky slopes, and
  rough places where its food plant occurs.</p>

  <p>The female will often lay her eggs in a chip-box when she is thus
  secured after capture; the caterpillars are not difficult to rear if
  flower buds of the bindweed can be obtained to start them upon.</p>

  <p>The species is especially common in the south-west of England, chiefly
  on the coast, but it seems to occur in most suitable localities in nearly
  all the southern counties, and its range extends to Gloucestershire on
  the west and to Norfolk on the east. About seventy-five years ago
  Stephens used to obtain specimens on a chalky ridge near Hertford, and
  recently the moth has been found at Hitchin in North Hertfordshire.</p>

<h5><b>The Purple Marbled</b> (<i>Thalpochares ostrina</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two Continental specimens of this little moth are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate21">21</a>, Figs. 1 typical, 2 ab. <i>carthami</i>. An
  example of this species was obtained in June, 1825, in a lane near
  Bideford, Devonshire, and Stephens refers to this as the only specimen of
  the species that up to that time (1830) had been noted in England.
  Nothing more was heard of <i>T. ostrina</i> until 1858, when another
  Devonshire specimen was taken, this time near Torquay, on June 8, and
  during the month several others were captured on the coast; two were also
  secured in the Isle of Wight, and one in Ayrshire, Scotland. In 1865, a
  specimen was recorded as taken in July a few years previously at Pembrey,
  South Wales; 1880, one at Dover in September, and one near Swanage;
  Barrett mentions specimens taken on the Culver Cliffs, Isle of Wight, in
  1859.</p>

  <p>It seems unquestionable that examples of this species captured in
  Britain, and also of the other two <i>Thalpochares</i> to be presently
  referred to, are immigrants, and it is quite conceivable that besides the
  specimens captured here, others which have escaped detection may also
  have arrived with them.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad is extensive, embracing South Europe, Turkey,
  Asia Minor, Egypt, North-west Africa, Madeira, and the Canary Isles. It
  has also been found in France and Germany, but its occurrence in the
  latter country has been even less frequent than in England. <!-- Page 56
  --><span class="pagenum" title="086.png"><a
  name="page56"></a>{56}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Small Marbled</b> (<i>Thalpochares parva</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species, of which a foreign example is represented on Plate <a
  href="#plate21">21</a>, Fig. 3, has a similar distribution to that of
  <i>T. ostrina</i>, only it does not seem to occur in Madeira or the
  Canaries, and its eastward range extends to Central and Southern
  India.</p>

  <p>The fore wings are pale reddish ochreous; first line, oblique, dusky,
  slightly waved on lower half, bordered inwardly with brownish and
  outwardly with white; second line, dusky and irregular.</p>

  <p>The earliest specimen noted in Britain was captured at Teignmouth,
  South Devon, in July, 1844; another was said to have been captured at
  Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, but it has been suggested that this specimen
  might probably be referable to <i>T. ostrina.</i> Mr. E. Bankes has a
  specimen, taken by himself on a salt marsh in the Isle of Purbeck,
  Dorset, June 8, 1892. This seems to be all that is definitely known of
  this species in Britain, but others have been noted from the Isle of
  Wight and the Isle of Man.</p>

<h5><i>Thalpochares paula.</i></h5>

  <p>The fore wings are white, clouded with pale brownish grey beyond the
  almost straight and rather oblique first line, and also beyond the
  angulated second line.</p>

  <p>Of this species (Plate <a href="#plate21">21</a>, Fig. 6) a specimen,
  now in the collection of Mr. E. R. Bankes, was taken at Freshwater, Isle
  of Wight, in June, 1872. Two other specimens, one of which seems to have
  been captured by a boy who was collecting on the south coast, were
  recorded in 1873; these insects were at that time in the collection of
  the Rev. H. Burney, and had been caught several years earlier.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends through Europe and Asia to South Siberia. The
  specimen figured is from Dresden. <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum" title="087.png"
  ><a name="page57"></a>{57}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Marbled White Spot</b> (<i>Hapalotis</i> (<i>Erastria</i>) <i>fasciana</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour of the fore wings of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate21">21</a>, Fig. 7) is brownish grey, more or less clouded
  and sometimes suffused with blackish; the white patch on the outer
  marginal area is, in some examples, much obscured by dark-grey markings,
  and in occasional specimens the only trace of white on this part of the
  wing is a thin edging to the second line (ab. <i>albilinea</i>,
  Haworth).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale yellowish, with a greenish, sometimes red,
  tinged line along the middle of the back, and a brown one on each side; a
  reddish line under the black spiracles; head, brownish; the raised dots
  of the body are dusky edged with reddish. It feeds from July to
  September. A reddish form of this caterpillar has been noted. Buckler,
  from whose description the above has been condensed, states that the
  food-plant is blue moor-grass, or purple melic-grass (<i>Molinia
  cærulea</i>), and this is confirmed by Bignell, who remarks that in
  Devonshire he easily finds the caterpillars "feeding about half way up
  the blades" of this grass.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, or in forward seasons in late May.
  It is partial to pine and larch trunks as a resting place during the day,
  and is local and more or less frequent in most of the southern counties,
  from Kent to Cornwall, through Somerset and Gloucester (extending into
  Oxford), to Hereford and Worcester, on the west, and from Essex to
  Norfolk on the east. A specimen was taken at light in Chester in June,
  1901.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Silver Barred</b> (<i>Bankia</i> (<i>Erastria</i>) <i>argentula</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form this species (Plate <a href="#plate21">21</a>,
  Fig. 4) has the colour of the fore wings olive brown, but occasionally it
  is <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum" title="088.png"><a
  name="page58"></a>{58}</span>tinged with reddish in some English, and
  more generally in Irish, specimens. The silvery oblique lines, or bands,
  vary in width, and sometimes there is a distinct spur from the lower
  outer edge of the first band.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish green, with a rather darker green line
  along the middle of the back, and a yellow one on each side of it. It
  feeds on grasses, such as <i>Poa aquatica</i> and <i>P. Pratensis</i>,
  etc., in July and early August.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June, and may be found during the day sitting about
  on the herbage in its marshy haunts, or flying over the vegetation
  towards the evening.</p>

  <p>The species is exceedingly local in Britain. In ancient times it
  occurred in Norfolk, but in the present day it seems to be confined to
  Cambridgeshire, in which county it was first noted rarely in Wicken fen
  about thirty years ago, but in 1882 it was found plentifully in
  Chippenham fen, and in that locality (which is a private one) the species
  still flourishes. In Ireland it is well distributed over co. Kerry, and
  is especially abundant on the bogs of Killarney.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland, where the brownish form var.
  <i>amurula</i>, Staud., is found.</p>

<h5><b>The Silver Hook</b> (<i>Hydrelia</i> (<i>Erastria</i>) <i>uncula</i>).</h5>

  <p>The usually olive brown central area of the fore wings is sometimes
  reddish tinged, and in fresh specimens the whitish front marginal streak
  is distinctly rosy; the reniform stigma, which appears to be a spur of
  the costal streak, is also white or rosy tinged, and sometimes encloses a
  greyish mark. This stigma is the so-called "hook" to which both the
  English name and the Latin specific name refer. (Plate <a
  href="#plate21">21</a>, Fig. 5.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds in July and early August on sedges
  (<i>Carex</i>) and coarse grasses. It is green, with three lines along
  the back, the central one rather darker green, and the other two whitish;
  low down along the sides is a broader yellowish line; the head is green
  with a yellowish tinge.</p>

  <p>The moth is out from late May to early July, sometimes later.</p>

  <p>This is also a marsh-loving species, and is generally plentiful in the
  fens of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire; in the Southern counties it
  is either very local or, owing to its small size, has escaped detection,
  but has been noted as occurring in Surrey (Wisley), Kent (Deal), Hants
  (New Forest), Dorset, Devon, Cornwall, and Somersetshire; also in
  Yorkshire (Askham bog), and in Cumberland. The Welsh counties in which it
  has been found are Pembroke, Glamorgan and Carnarvon (Abersoch). It is
  locally common in Clydesdale, and has also been reported from
  Kirkcudbrightshire, and Perthshire. In Ireland it abounds in the boggy
  parts of Kerry, and is more or less frequent in several other parts of
  Ireland. Near Castle Bellingham, co. Louth, where it is common, a second
  brood was observed on Aug. 1st, 1894.</p>

  <p>Its range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Rosy Marbled</b> (<i>Erastria venustula</i>).</h5>

  <p>Another local species, but a frequenter of drier localities than the
  last two. This delicate rosy-flushed whitish moth first became known as a
  native of Britain by the capture of a few specimens in Essex. Stephens,
  writing in 1830, remarks, "I have hitherto seen four examples
  only&mdash;a pair in my own cabinet; one of the latter taken, I believe,
  in Epping forest by the late Mr. Honey, the other by the late Mr.
  Bentley." No other British specimens seem to have been recorded until
  1845, when the late Mr. H. Doubleday, in July, noted several of the moths
  disporting themselves over, or settling upon, bracken in Epping Forest.
  For many years Loughton and some other parts of the forest remained the
  only known English haunts of the species, but in 1874 it was found
  commonly in <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum" title="092.png"><a
  name="page60"></a>{60}</span>St. Leonard's Forest, Sussex; later still,
  it was discovered in the Brentwood district, Essex. It still occurs in
  all these localities, but appears to be now less frequently noticed in
  the original one than formerly (Plate <a href="#plate21">21</a>, Fig.
  9).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds in July and August on the flowers of cinquefoil
  (<i>Potentilla</i>), and is said to eat bramble blossoms also. Hellins
  describes it as rich brown, with a row of eight dusky-red diamonds down
  the back, enclosing the dorsal line of brighter red. The moth is out from
  the end of May and in June; it may be put up from herbage during the day,
  but its proper time of flight is in the early evening, and then only when
  the weather is favourable. If cold or damp the insects will not get on
  the wing. (Plate <a href="#plate25">25</a>, Fig. 3; after Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Straw Dot</b> (<i>Rivula sericealis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This pale ochreous species, an example of which is represented on
  Plate <a href="#plate21">21</a>, Fig. 8, varies in the amount of darker
  shading or suffusion on the outer marginal area of the fore wing;
  sometimes this is grey-brown or pale reddish brown, but often there is no
  shading whatever, and in such specimens the ground colour is usually very
  pale. The dark brown reniform mark is always present, but the cross lines
  are more often absent than present.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with a darker green line along the middle of
  the back, and a white stripe on each side of it, the inner edge of each
  of the latter irregular; head, greenish grey, and the bristle-bearing
  raised dots are shining green with a dusky cap. It feeds on
  <i>Brachypodium sylvaticum</i>, but seems to accommodate itself to a diet
  of <i>Phalaris arundinacea</i>, and would perhaps eat other grasses:
  August to May. (Plate <a href="#plate23">23</a>, Fig. 3; after
  Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out all through the summer months, and <!-- Page 61
  --><span class="pagenum" title="093.png"><a
  name="page61"></a>{61}</span>frequents marshes, damp rides and borders of
  woods, heaths, and where there is plenty of tall grass.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed over England and Wales, although it
  appears to be rather scarce in the midlands and northwards. In Ireland it
  is generally abundant, but in Scotland it has only been noted from the
  south, and is there local and rare.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad includes Amurland, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Purple Barred</b> (<i>Prothymnia viridaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate21">21</a>, Figs.
  10 &#x2642;, 11 &#x2640;) range in colour from olive grey to olive brown,
  and are frequently adorned with two rosy-red (typical) or purplish bands
  (<i>ænea</i>, Haw.). In some specimens the bands are of a dusky hue and
  not very distinct, whilst in others the wings are of a uniform dingy
  brown tint (ab. <i>fusca</i>, Tutt).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate25">25</a>, Fig. 2) is
  velvety-green above and paler beneath, yellowish between the rings, with
  a dark green slender line bordered by paler lines along the back, and
  three pale lines along the sides; below the yellowish spiracles there is
  a broader pale line becoming whitish on rings 9-12; head, green mottled
  with brown (adapted from Hellins).</p>

  <p>It is to be found in August and September on the common milkwort
  (<i>Polygala vulgaris</i>). On May 31, 1906, I met with the moth in some
  numbers on a marshy bit of heath in Surrey, where there was a plentiful
  growth of lousewort (<i>Pedicularis</i>), but, so far as I know, no
  <i>Polygala</i>. All the moths were much below the average size, the
  bands were mainly purple, but in no case rosy. The moth flies in May and
  June, and specimens have been captured both earlier and later. Except
  that it does not appear to occur in the extreme north of Scotland, the
  species seems to be pretty generally distributed over the British Isles,
  and is often very common in many parts.</p>

  <p>The eastern distribution extends to E. Siberia. <!-- Page 62 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="094.png"><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Spotted Sulphur</b> (<i>Emmelia trabealis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Although this pretty black and yellow moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate21">21</a>, Fig. 12) was noted by Stephens (1830) as being
  occasionally captured in Battersea fields, and as occurring near Margate,
  and elsewhere in Kent, it was not until 1847 that the Breck-sand district
  of Norfolk, adjoining parts of Suffolk, and Cambridge, became known as
  being inhabited by The Spotted Sulphur. The vicinity of Brandon and
  Tuddenham is especially favoured by the species, but it occurs in several
  other parts of the area. Occasionally, specimens have been captured in
  various Kentish localities, and between thirty and forty years ago single
  examples were taken in Hackney Marshes, Lower Clapton (August 2), also in
  Wandsworth (at light, July 26). From these facts it would appear possible
  that the species occasionally strays from its haunts in the eastern
  counties and sometimes to a considerable distance. Once, indeed, a
  specimen was found on a gas lamp at Exeter. On the other hand, it is
  quite conceivable that such wanderers may have come from abroad.</p>

  <p>Some specimens are of a paler yellow than others, but there is rather
  more noticeable aberration in the number and intensity of the black
  markings.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is reddish brown, with three darker lines along the
  back, the central one pale edged; a pale yellow stripe runs along the
  region of the spiracles, and has a fine brownish line running through it
  from end to end. Another form is green with white lines. It feeds on the
  bindweed (<i>Convolvulus arvensis</i>) in July, and has a second brood in
  September. The moth, which rests among herbage by day, and flies towards
  evening, is found in June, July, and August.</p>

  <p>The species is found throughout Central and Southern Europe, its range
  extending to Denmark and South Sweden; eastward it occurs in Asia Minor,
  Syria, and through Asia to Japan. <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum" title="095.png"
  ><a name="page63"></a>{63}</span></p>

<h5 class="lg125">GONOPTERINÆ.</h5>

<h5><b>The Herald</b> (<i>Scoliopteryx libatrix</i>).</h5>

  <p>Haworth (1802) gave this attractive species the English name of
  "Furbelow Moth," but Harris (1782) had named it Herald Moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate22">22</a>, Fig. 1).</p>

  <p>In the majority of specimens the purplish, or grey-brown fore wings,
  are more or less reddish tinged throughout, but occasionally the outer
  marginal area is free of this tint; the orange red marks on the central
  and basal areas are brighter in some specimens than in others.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds on sallow, osier, willow, and probably
  poplar (a chrysalis having been found in a curled leaf of black poplar),
  is a long, rather thin, greenish creature without any distinct markings,
  except that when full grown the front rings have two black spots. It may
  be found reposing on the upper leaves of its foodplant, from June to
  August. (Plate <a href="#plate25">25</a>, Fig. 1, from a coloured drawing
  by Mr. A. Sich.)</p>

  <p>The moth may be obtained at sugar, ivy-blossom, etc., from August to
  October, and it seems that the earliest to emerge are those that first
  take up hibernating quarters in barns, outhouses, roofs, belfries, and
  under arches. In the spring it reappears, and may be met with even in
  June. A specimen was taken at sugar on July 20, 1899, but whether this is
  to be regarded as a very late date or an unusually early one, I cannot
  say. Generally distributed throughout Great Britain and Ireland, but of
  the Scottish Isles only recorded from Shetland. Abroad it ranges through
  Europe to North-West Africa, and through Asia to Amurland and Japan; also
  in temperate North America.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note</span>.&mdash;Stephens (1829) referred this
  species to the genus <i>Calyptra</i>, Ochs., but in 1831 he adopted
  <i>Scoliopteryx</i>, Germar (1811). <i>Gonoptera</i>, Latr., which has
  been frequently used, only dates from 1825. <!-- Page 64 --><span

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Golden Plusia at rest.</b></p>

    <p style="text-align:center">(Photo by H. Main.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The British history of the grey tinged pale golden species, shown on
  Plate <a href="#plate22">22</a>, Fig. 4, dates back only to 1890. In that
  year, on July 2, Mr. Christy, of Watergate, Emsworth, found a specimen in
  his illuminated moth trap; this was noted in the <i>Entomologist</i> for
  August, 1890. From subsequent records it appears that a specimen had been
  taken on the same date at a gas lamp near Reading, by Mr. W. Holland;
  whilst one was captured, at a light, near Tunbridge Wells on July 1. The
  earliest British specimen, however, was one netted whilst hovering over
  flowers of <i>Delphinium</i> at Dover, on June 25 of the same year, but
  this was not announced until October. Since its arrival here the species
  seems to have spread over England at a great rate, and it has recently
  been reported from Cheshire. In some southern gardens the caterpillars
  abound to such an extent that they are regarded as a plague. On the
  continent it is said to feed on sunflower, artichoke, burdock, and
  cucumber.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, dotted with white; a dark line along the
  back and a white one along the sides. In the early stage it is black or
  sooty brown, and hides itself among the spun together flower buds, or in
  a turned down tender leaf. It feeds in May and June, occasionally found
  in late April, after hibernation, and a second generation sometimes
  occurs in July and August. Monkshood (<i>Aconitum</i>) and larkspur
  (<i>Delphinium</i>) are the usual food plants, and it is curious to note
  that whilst some observers state that larkspur alone is eaten, others say
  that monkshood is the only food. The moth flies in June and July, and
  sometimes there is an emergence in August and September. It visits the
  blossoms of various garden plants, and is also attracted by light.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, represented on Plate <a href="#plate27">27</a>, Fig.
  1, was found with others on larkspur in Mr. Herbert Smith's garden at
  Wallington, Surrey. The cocoon and chrysalis is from a photo by Mr. H.
  Main. Another photo by Mr. Main shows the young caterpillar constructing
  its retreat.</p>

  <p>According to Duponchel this species occurred in Normandy, Central and
  Northern Europe, as far back as 1829. A much paler form inclining to
  silvery, var. <i>esmeralda</i>, Oberthür, is found in Ussuri, North
  China, and other parts of East Asia.</p>

<h5><b>The Burnished Brass</b> (<i>Plusia chrysitis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two forms of this metallic-looking species are represented (Plate <a
  href="#plate22">22</a>); 5 is typical and 6 shows the ab. <i>juncta</i>,
  Tutt. Between these are various intermediate stages leading to the
  complete division of the central band. The broken central band is a
  character of var. <i>nadeja</i>, Oberthür, from Amurland and <!-- Page 66
  --><span class="pagenum" title="100.png"><a
  name="page66"></a>{66}</span>Japan, but that form has also a more or less
  complete series of ochreous-brown dots on the outer area. The metallic
  colour is sometimes greenish in all forms.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale green, with a darker green line along the
  middle of the back, bordered on each side by an irregular white line; an
  oblique white streak on the sides of each ring from 4-11; a stripe low
  down along the sides is white; head, yellowish tinged. It feeds on
  stinging nettle, probably on other plants, and after hibernation attains
  full growth about May. In favourable seasons caterpillars also occur in
  July and August. The moth is out in June, July, and August, less
  frequently in September, and may be found flying along the sides of
  hedges and ditches, especially where flowering weeds are plentiful,
  throughout the British Isles; so far, however, it has not been recorded
  from the Hebrides, Orkneys, or Shetlands.</p>

<h5><b>The Scarce Burnished Brass</b> (<i>Plusia chryson</i>).</h5>

  <p>The more or less square golden (sometimes green-tinged) patch on the
  velvety purplish brown fore wings, distinguish this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate24">24</a>, Fig. 1) from any other British <i>Plusia</i>.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with a darker line along the middle of the
  back, and a fine white line on each side of it; there is a dark green
  stripe low down along the sides, edged below with white, and oblique
  white lines run from it to the central line on rings 3-11. It feeds on
  hemp-agrimony (<i>Eupatorium cannabinum</i>), hibernates when small, and
  completes its growth in May or early June.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, and is said to be occasionally
  seen, on sunny days, flying about, or resting on, the flowers of the
  hemp-agrimony and other plants. Night, however, is its more usual time of
  activity, and it may also be found at the blossoms of the larval food
  plant, and at those of honeysuckle, etc. <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="101.png"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span></p>

  <p>The species has been found, chiefly in the past in most of the
  southern counties of England from Kent (Deal district) to Cornwall, also
  in Gloucestershire, and in South Wales. Chippenham fen in Cambridgeshire
  is the most noted locality for it in the present day, and it has been
  found in Norfolk and Suffolk. There is even a record of a specimen having
  been beaten out of honeysuckle near Preston, Lancs., but this happened
  nearly forty years ago.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Gold Spangle</b> (<i>Plusia bractea</i>).</h5>

  <p>The purplish brown fore wings of this moth have a bright solid-looking
  golden mark on the upper edge of a velvety, deep brown patch. This
  metallic "spangle" varies a little in size and in shape, but not to any
  noteworthy extent (Plate <a href="#plate24">24</a>, Fig. 2).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is bright green, dotted with white, above, and dull
  darker green below; there is a fine dark green line along the middle of
  the back, some indistinct and irregular white lines followed by a whitish
  stripe lower down, along the sides. It seems to feed upon a variety of
  low-growing plants, among which are groundsel, dandelion, white
  dead-nettle (<i>Lamium album</i>), and stinging nettle, also on
  honeysuckle, from August to May. In a state of nature, it hibernates when
  small, and becomes full grown in May or early June, but when reared from
  the egg it can be induced, by keeping it in a warm place, to continue
  feeding, grow up quickly, pupate, and assume the winged state in the late
  autumn. Under such artificial conditions it is said to eat lettuce and
  plantain.</p>

  <p>Normally, the moth is out in June and July, and has been met with in
  August. Like all members of this group it is partial to flowers, and has
  been frequently taken at those of the honeysuckle, although all sorts of
  blossoms, down to the lowly <i>Viola cornuta</i>, have attraction for it.
  <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum" title="102.png"><a
  name="page68"></a>{68}</span></p>

  <p>The species is more especially a denizen of Ireland and Scotland, but
  it occurs in most of the northern counties of England, and has been
  recorded from Worcestershire and Herefordshire; also from Carmarthenshire
  in South Wales.</p>

  <p>Abroad, its range extends to Central Asia; and in Amurland and Japan
  it is represented by P. excelsa, Kretschmar.</p>

<h5><b>The Gold Spot</b> (<i>Plusia festucæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>In this species (Plate <a href="#plate24">24</a>, Figs. 3 and 4) the
  fore wings are golden brown, clouded with purplish brown; sometimes the
  purplish brown is confined almost entirely to the broad area. Besides the
  large central metallic marks, there are more or less conspicuous patches
  of metallic colour at the base of the costa, on the middle of the inner
  margin, and towards the tips of the wings. Usually the central spots are
  clearly apart, but I have one example from Bishop Auckland, Durham, in
  which they are only separated one from the other by a slender brown
  line.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with a white-edged dark-green line along the
  middle of the back, and some slender yellowish lines on each side of it;
  a whitish or yellow tinged stripe low down along the sides; head, tinged
  with brown.</p>

  <p>It feeds on sedge, coarse grasses, bur-reed (<i>Sparganium
  ramosum</i>), and yellow-flag (<i>Iris pseudacorus</i>); also said by
  Collins to eat water plantain (<i>Alisma plantago</i>): April to June,
  and in some localities and seasons, again in July and August. The black
  chrysalis is enclosed in a rather long greyish cocoon, spun up on the
  undersides of the leaves of sedge or reed; usually placed towards the tip
  of the leaf, which droops over and so hides it.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, and in some years there seems to be
  an emergence in August and September; this has been more particularly
  noted in Cheshire, where Arkle has had moths emerge in June, July,
  August, and September. A second flight has been noted in Ireland by Kane
  and others; and late examples have also been recorded from Scotland.</p>

  <p>Although it has been recorded from some of the southern counties, it
  is most frequent in the eastern and northern parts of England, and in
  South Wales. Occurs throughout Scotland up to Moray; and in Ireland it is
  found in most localities, though not often common, except by the sea in
  Co. Kerry, and in Connamara, Co. Galway.</p>

  <p>Abroad, it extends to East Siberia, Amurland, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Plain Golden Y</b> (<i>Plusia iota</i>).</h5>

  <p>In typical specimens the metallic mark is V-shaped, with a dot below
  and a little to one side (Plate <a href="#plate24">24</a>, Fig. 8). In
  ab. <i>percontationis</i>, Treit. (Fig. 7), these spots are united and
  form a Y-like mark. Sometimes the spot is absent and the V-mark much
  reduced, and more rarely the V also disappears (ab. <i>inscripta</i>,
  Esp.).</p>

  <p>The larva is yellowish green, white dotted, with a white-edged darker
  line along the middle of the back; a band composed of whitish irregular
  lines runs along the sides, and a thin yellow line along the area of the
  spiracles. It hatches from the egg in the late summer, hibernates when
  quite small, and feeds up in the spring. The food plants comprise the
  dead nettles (<i>Lamium</i>), woundwort (<i>Stachys</i>), mint, stinging
  nettle, honeysuckle, hawthorn, etc. There is a record of sixteen larvæ
  which hibernated among dead leaves of <i>Lamium album</i>, resumed
  feeding on February 18, spun up April 23-25, and produced moths May
  27-June 4. Usually the moth is on the wing in June and July.</p>

  <p>The species seems to be pretty widely distributed throughout the
  British Isles to the Orkneys; it was not known to occur in the Hebrides
  until 1901, when McArthur obtained it in the Isle of Lewis. <!-- Page 70
  --><span class="pagenum" title="106.png"><a
  name="page70"></a>{70}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Beautiful Golden Y</b> (<i>Plusia pulchrina</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate24">24</a>, Figs. 5 and 6) so
  closely resembles the last that it has been considered a variety thereof;
  there is no question, however, that it is quite distinct. The fore wings
  in both species are somewhat similar in general tints, but the following
  points of difference distinguish <i>pulchrina</i>&mdash;the darker colour
  is less evenly displayed, and gives the wings a more mottled or marbled
  appearance; the cross lines, especially those on the basal area, are
  almost invariably golden edged; the second cross line is more acutely
  bent inwards above the inner margin, the reniform has a more or less
  complete golden outline, and it is placed in a dark cloud; the golden
  V-mark and dot below are generally thicker. As a rule, the fringes of all
  the wings are more distinctly chequered, but this feature cannot be
  relied on alone in separating one species from the other. In ab.
  <i>percontatrix</i>, Aurivillius (= <i>juncta</i>, Tutt), the golden V
  and dot are united and so form a Y-mark (Fig. 5).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green with a broad central white stripe and several
  finer white lines along the back; a yellowish-tinted white stripe low
  down along the sides; head shining, marked with black on each side of the
  mouth. This caterpillar has the bristles rather more in evidence than
  they are in the larva of <i>P. iota</i>. It feeds on various low-growing
  plants, such as the dead nettles, groundsel, etc., also on honeysuckle
  and bilberry.</p>

  <p>The moth occurs in June and July, and is found more or less frequently
  all over the British Isles to Orkney, but in England is more plentiful
  from the Midlands northwards than in the southern counties.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Ni Moth</b> (<i>Plusia ni</i>).</h5>

  <p>The present species (Plate <a href="#plate26">26</a>, Fig. 3) bears a
  strong resemblance to a small pale specimen of <i>P. gamma</i>; but, as
  <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum" title="107.png"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>will be noted, the silvery central Y-mark is
  differently formed. Here it is made up of a curve somewhat like the
  letter U, and an oval or round spot, the latter very close to and
  sometimes, as in the example figured, united with the former.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds on cabbage and other Cruciferæ, also on
  lettuce, tomato, etc., is green, inclining to yellowish green and dotted
  with white; three white lines along the back, and a white stripe along
  the sides. It is said to be more slender in form than the caterpillar of
  <i>P. gamma</i>. (Plate <a href="#plate28">28</a>, Fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>The earliest British specimen was taken at flowers of red valerian in
  a garden at Exeter, August, 1868. The next year a specimen occurred, also
  in a garden, at Penzance. Then followed captures in Dorset, one 1885, and
  one (Isle of Portland) 1888. Two caterpillars were found in the Isle of
  Portland in 1894, and these produced moths in September of that year. At
  least eight moths were secured at Penzance in 1894, and specimens were
  subsequently reared from caterpillars found on cabbages in the gardens
  around Lynwood. In May, 1896, one example of the moth was taken by Mr.
  Percy Richards at Norbiton, Surrey. The last recorded capture appears to
  be that by Mr. Finzi of a female specimen at Tenby, South Wales, on June
  9, 1906. She deposited a few eggs in the collecting-box, and the
  caterpillars that hatched from them were reared on broccoli and lettuce,
  and produced moths, July 24-30.</p>

  <p><i>Plusia ni</i> ranges through south-east and southern Europe, to
  Asia Minor, North Africa, and the Canaries. In the Isle of Capri it is
  said to be almost as common as <i>P. gamma</i>. <i>Brassicæ</i>, Riley
  (1870), is a well-known <i>Plusia</i> in America, where it is classed
  among noxious insects. It is somewhat larger and browner in colour than
  European <i>ni</i>, but in every other respect it seems to agree so
  exactly that it can hardly be considered specifically distinct. <!-- Page
  72 --><span class="pagenum" title="108.png"><a
  name="page72"></a>{72}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Silver Y</b> (<i>Plusia gamma</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species, represented by portraits of two specimens on Plate <a
  href="#plate26">26</a>, Figs. 1 and 2, varies somewhat in the ground
  colour of the fore wings, which ranges from a whitish grey through
  various tints of grey and brown to velvety black. The melanic form last
  referred to is very rare, but I caught one example of it at Eastbourne in
  the late summer of 1888, and I saw, but did not secure, another near
  Esher in the autumn of 1906; one taken at Dartmoor in September, 1894, is
  in Mr. F. J. Hanbury's collection.</p>

  <p>Occasionally a purplish red tinge, often present below the silvery Y,
  spreads over a larger area of the fore wings. The Y-mark is well defined
  as a rule, but now and then specimens are found in which only the tail of
  the Y is distinct.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar varies in general colour from pale green to a dark
  olive green approaching black. In the white dotted paler green forms
  there are several transverse whitish lines, some of them wavy, between
  the yellowish spiracular line and the dark green line along the middle of
  the back; head, marked with black on each cheek. It will eat almost every
  kind of low-growing vegetation, either wild or cultivated, and in some
  years may be found throughout the summer. Small larvæ were recorded as
  seen at the end of October, 1901. The blackish chrysalis is enclosed in a
  whitish cocoon, often placed under leaves of thistle, burdock, etc.</p>

  <p>The moth is seen in the spring and early summer (most probably
  immigrants), and again in the autumn, when it is generally more
  abundant.</p>

  <p>This well-known migrating species has been observed in greater or
  lesser numbers over the whole of the British Isles. Its distribution
  abroad embraces the Palæarctic Region, North Africa, and North America.
  <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum" title="109.png"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Scarce Silver Y</b> (<i>Plusia interrogationis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Portraits of two examples of this species will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate26">26</a>, Figs. 4 and 5. The metallic central marks on the
  fore wings vary a good deal in size and in form, and are sometimes almost
  absent; these wings have the general greyish colour more clouded or
  suffused with blackish in some specimens than in others. Kane states that
  Irish specimens, when freshly emerged, have a tinge of violet purple, and
  Tutt notes some British specimens as beautifully tinted with rose colour
  (ab. <i>rosea</i>).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds on heather (<i>Calluna</i>) and bilberry
  (<i>Vaccinium</i>), is green inclining to blackish on the sides and
  underparts, with six white lines along the back; two of which are
  irregular; the raised dots are white and the bristles therefrom dark;
  head, green dashed with purple, shining. (Fenn.) After hibernation it may
  be found without much difficulty in May and June on its food plants,
  either in the daytime, or by the aid of a lamp at night. Large numbers
  fall victims to parasitical flies. (Plate <a href="#plate28">28</a>, Fig.
  2.) The white cocoons enclosing the black chrysalids are spun up on or
  under the twigs of bilberry and heather. The moth is out in July and
  August, and may be found on moorlands, in the north of England from
  Shropshire (with Radnor) and Staffordshire on the west, and Lincolnshire
  on the east, through Scotland to Sutherland, and in all suitable
  localities in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Dark Spectacle</b> (<i>Abrostola triplasia</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this moth are blackish grey inclining to purplish
  and rather shining; the basal area is pale reddish brown, edged by a
  curved dark chocolate brown cross line; a reddish grey band on the outer
  area clouded with ground colour <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum" title="110.png"
  ><a name="page74"></a>{74}</span>and edged above the inner margin by a
  dark chocolate brown curved line; raised scales on the central area and
  on the cross lines. Two oval reddish brown marks on the front of the
  collar have some resemblance to a pair of spectacles, hence the English
  name. (Plate <a href="#plate22">22</a>, Fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, sprinkled with white dots; on rings 4, 5,
  and 11 are whitish-edged darker marks, and there is a dark line, also
  whitish-edged, along the middle of the back between rings 5 and 11; a
  white line on the back from ring 4 to the brownish head, and white-edged
  dark oblique lines on the sides of rings 6 to 11; the line low down along
  the sides is whitish with an ochreous tinge. A purplish brown form also
  occurs (Plate <a href="#plate27">27</a>, Fig. 2), in which the pale
  markings are ochreous tinged. It is found from July to September on
  nettle and hops, the latter more especially. The earlier caterpillars, in
  some years, attain the moth state in August or early September, but the
  bulk of them remain in the chrysalis state during the winter, the moth
  emerging in June or July of the following year.</p>

  <p>The species is not uncommon in most southern English counties, but
  becomes less frequent or more local northwards from the Midlands to
  Cumberland, Northumberland, and South Scotland. It occurs in Wales, and
  is widely spread in Ireland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Spectacle</b> (<i>Abrostola tripartita</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species, known also as <i>urticæ</i>, Hübner, has the basal and
  outer marginal areas of the fore wings whitish grey, finely mottled with
  darker grey; the central area is greyish brown, mottled with darker
  brown. The spectacle mark in front of the thorax is whitish grey, ringed
  with black, and the raised scales on the cross lines and central area of
  the fore wings are more distinct in this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate22">22</a>, Fig. 3). The <!-- Page 75 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="111.png"><a
  name="page75"></a>{75}</span>caterpillar is pale green, with white-edged
  dark-green <img src="images/mark1.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="sideways vee"
  />-shaped marks along the back, most in evidence on rings 4-11; two
  slender whitish lines on each side, only distinct on rings 1-4; a white
  stripe low down along the sides, edged above with dark green and with
  whitish streaks from it to the white edging of the marks on the back.
  Head, green, rather shining, with dusky marks on each cheek (adapted from
  Fenn). It feeds in July, at night, on the common stinging nettle, from
  the foliage of which it may be beaten out, or, by searching, found on the
  undersides of the leaves. In some years there is a second brood in
  September.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June, sometimes late May, and, when there is a
  second emergence, in August. Occasionally it is seen on fences, etc., but
  at night it visits the blossoms of various plants, both wild and
  cultivated; the flowers of spur-valerian (<i>Centranthus ruber</i>),
  honeysuckle, and woundwort (<i>Stachys</i>) being especially attractive,
  as also they are to the Dark Spectacle, and most of the species of
  <i>Plusia</i>.</p>

  <p>Although apparently commoner in some counties than in others, this
  species ranges over the British Isles to the Orkneys.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Mother Shipton</b> (<i>Euclidia mi</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ancient fathers of British Entomology were sometimes happy in
  their selection of names in the vernacular for those of our moths that
  were known to them at the time, and the present species is a fair example
  of this. Moses Harris first dubbed it the Shipton Moth, but afterwards
  changed the name to the "Mask Moth." Both names refer to the peculiar
  shape of the markings which adorn the fore wings and bear a more or less
  fanciful resemblance to a grotesque mask, and even more closely to the
  profile of an historical dame yclept <!-- Page 76 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="112.png"><a name="page76"></a>{76}</span>Shipton.
  This character, also supposed to be like the letter M, hence the specific
  name <i>mi</i>, stands out very distinctly in the paler specimens, but in
  some of the darker individuals it is somewhat obscured. On the hind wings
  the spots are whitish or yellowish, and those composing the central
  series are sometimes united, and form a band. (Plate <a
  href="#plate26">26</a>, Figs. 6 &#x2642;, 7 &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The egg is greenish, and the caterpillar is pale ochreous-brown, with
  darker brown lines along the back and sides: head, ochreous, with brown
  lines. It feeds on clover and grasses, in July, August, and September,
  and the chrysalis, which is covered with a whitish powder, is enclosed in
  a brownish cocoon spun up in a blade of grass. All the early stages are
  figured on Plate <a href="#plate30">30</a>. The enlarged chrysalis, Fig.
  1, is from a photo by Mr. H. Main. The moth flies in May and June, and is
  often common in meadows, on railway banks, and other sloping banks and
  such-like places where wild flowers abound. The species is widely
  distributed over England, Wales, and South Scotland; also Ireland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Burnet Companion</b> (<i>Euclidia glyphica</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour of the fore wings is purplish brown, sometimes
  becoming greyish on the outer area; the space between the dark brown or
  blackish cross bands is sometimes filled up with the darker colour. Some
  specimens are much greyer than others, and all the examples in a series
  from the Lake district that I have seen were distinctly grey, with very
  dark bands. The yellow on the hind wings sometimes inclines to orange,
  and sometimes it is so pale as to be almost whitish; there is also
  variation in the amount of black marking and shading on these wings.
  (Plate <a href="#plate26">26</a>, Figs. 8 &#x2642;, 9 &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is somewhat similar to that of the last species; it
  feeds on clovers and trefoils in July and August, but so far does not
  seem to have been noted to eat grasses.</p>

  <p>The moth is on the wing at the end of May and in June, and inhabits
  similar kinds of places to those mentioned for the last species, often in
  company with it, and also with the Burnet moths. Widely distributed over
  the greater part of the British Isles; common in some southern
  localities. Its distribution abroad extends to Amurland, and in Japan it
  is represented by the larger and paler form <i>consors</i>, Butler.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Leucanitis</i> (<i>Ophiusa</i>) <i>stolida</i>, Fab.&mdash;An
  example of this species, which is a native of Africa and South Europe,
  was captured by Mr. J. Jäger in the neighbourhood of Dartmouth, S. Devon.
  It was in fine condition, and came to sugar on September 23, 1903.</p>

<h5><b>The Lunar Double Stripe</b> (<i>Pseudophia lunaris</i>).</h5>

  <p>The portrait of this species on Plate <a href="#plate29">29</a>, Fig.
  1, is taken from a Spanish example. Exceedingly few British specimens
  have been recorded. The earliest seems to be the following: "Among my
  cabinet specimens there is one example of <i>Ophiodes lunaris</i>,
  captured at the Lowestoft Light in 1832. I conclude this is a great
  rarity, having seen many cabinets without it.&mdash;E. Chawner."
  <i>Entom.</i> vi. p. 147 (1872-73). Presumably this is the same specimen
  as that mentioned by Stainton (1857), Newman (1869), and later authors,
  as taken in Hants by Captain Chawner. In 1860 one example was obtained at
  sugar at West Wickham; and in 1864 Bouchard caught two specimens at
  Killarney. On June 17, 1873, one came to sugar in Abbots Wood, Sussex;
  one at Brighton in June, 1874, and another in Sussex, May, 1875. One
  specimen came to light in Norfolk, May, 1878; and one to sugar at
  Folkestone, May, 1892. In June, 1901, a specimen was secured in Delamere
  Forest, Cheshire, also at sugar. Dr. B. White's record of a capture at
  Perth makes a total of eleven specimens. <!-- Page 78 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="116.png"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous brown, sprinkled and lined with reddish
  brown; a stripe low down along the sides is reddish orange. It feeds, in
  July and August, on the leaves of oak and poplar, but it has not been
  found in our Isles.</p>

<h5><b>The Alchymist</b> (<i>Catephia alchymista</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth seems to have been known as a British species to Haworth,
  but he, and subsequently Stephens (1830), referred it to <i>Noctua
  leucomelas</i>, Linn. At all events, Stephen's description of the
  specimen in Haworth's cabinet bearing this name applies exactly to <i>C.
  alchymista</i>. In the <i>Ent. Ann.</i> for 1860 there is a figure of a
  specimen that was taken at sugar in the Isle of Wight, September, 1868.
  Seven years later, one was captured in an oak wood near Horsham, Sussex
  (June 4), and another found on the trunk of an oak tree near Colchester
  (June 9). In 1882, a specimen was taken at sugar in a wood near Dover
  (June), and on June 24, 1888, one came to sugar at St. Leonards, Sussex.
  In the last-named year, two other specimens, said to have been taken in
  the Isle of Wight, July, 1867, were recorded.</p>

  <p>Fig. 2, Plate <a href="#plate29">29</a>, represents a specimen from
  Dalmatia.</p>

<h5><b>The Clifden Nonpareil</b> (<i>Catocala fraxini</i>).</h5>

  <p>This handsome species (Plate <a href="#plate29">29</a>, Fig. 3) seems
  to have been known to quite the earliest writers on, and delineators of,
  British moths, and a specimen in the Dale collection, now in the Hope
  Museum, Oxford, was obtained in Dorset in 1740. Stephens (1830) mentions
  captures in the years 1821, 1827, and 1828. Since that time the
  occurrence of the species in the British Isles, chiefly in single
  specimens, may be tabulated as follows: England&mdash;London, 1842, 1870,
  1872. Kent, 1889, <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum" title="117.png"
  ><a name="page79"></a>{79}</span>1893, 1895, 1900. Sussex, 1838, 1869,
  1889, 1895. Isle of Wight, 1866, 1900. North Devon, 1895. Somerset, 1850.
  Shropshire, 1872. Suffolk, 1868, 1872, 1901, 1905. Norfolk, 1846, 1872,
  1894, 1900. Lincoln, 1872. Yorkshire, five specimens in all, the most
  recent in 1896. Lancashire, six specimens, latest 1868. Cheshire, four
  specimens, latest 1868. Scotland&mdash;1876 (Berwick); 1896 (Aberdeen and
  Orkney); 1898 (Roxburghshire). Ireland&mdash;1845, 1896.</p>

  <p>It may be noted that during a period of seven years&mdash;1866 to 1872
  inclusive&mdash;1867 and 1871 were the only years in which a specimen was
  not recorded from some part of England.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale ochreous, tinged with greenish and freckled
  with brown; head, pinkish, inclining to purplish above. It feeds on
  poplar in May, June, and July. From eggs (obtained from abroad) the
  caterpillars hatched April 27 till May 9, pupated between June 17 and 27,
  and the moths emerged July 20 to August 4.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends through Central Europe to Scandinavia, and
  eastward to Amurland.</p>

<h5><i>Catocala electa.</i></h5>

  <p>Only two specimens of this moth are known to have occurred in Britain.
  One of these was taken at Shoreham, near Brighton, Sussex, September 24,
  1875, and the other at Corfe Castle, Dorsetshire, September 12, 1892. The
  specimen shown on Plate <a href="#plate31">31</a>, Fig. 1, is from
  Saxony.</p>

  <p>In a general way this species is not unlike (<i>C. nupta</i>), but the
  fore wings are smoother looking, of a softer grey coloration, and the
  black cross lines are more irregular; the black markings on the crimson
  hind wings are similar, but the inner edge of the marginal border is more
  even.</p>

  <p>This Central European species ranges to Amurland and Corea, and is
  represented in Japan by a larger form, <i>zalmunna</i>, Butler. <!-- Page
  80 --><span class="pagenum" title="118.png"><a
  name="page80"></a>{80}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Red Underwing</b> (<i>Catocala nupta</i>).</h5>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:34%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Red Underwing at rest.</b></p>

    <p style="text-align:center">Photo by H. Main.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Both sexes of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate31">31</a>, Figs. 2 and 3. The fore wings are darker in some
  specimens than in others, and very rarely, in connection with a change in
  the hind wings from red to brownish, there has been a purplish tinge over
  all the wings. Specimens with the hind wings of a brown tint have only so
  far been noted in the environs of London. In 1892 one was taken at
  Mitcham (warm brown), another at Wandsworth, 1895, a third at Chingford,
  1896 (dusky black-brown), and a fourth at Brondesbury in 1897. At a
  meeting of the South London Entomological and Natural History Society,
  held on January 10, 1889, a coloured sketch of a specimen with blue hind
  wings, taken at Colchester, was exhibited (ab. <i>cærulescens</i>,
  Cockerell). Sometimes the hind wings are a dingy red, or they may incline
  to an orange tint; the central black band usually terminates just beyond
  the middle, but there is often a detached blackish cloud on the inner
  margin; and I have two specimens in which the band unites with this
  cloud.</p>

  <p>The eggs which are deposited on bark of poplar trees, as Fig.
  2<i>a</i> on Plate <a href="#plate33">33</a>, are deep purplish with a
  whitish bloom, and inclining to yellowish on the top. The caterpillar
  (Plate <a href="#plate33">33</a>, Fig. 2) is whitish-grey clouded and
  mottled with darker brown; the head is rather paler grey, marked with
  black. It feeds at night on willow and poplar, and, although rather
  difficult to detect, may be found in the chinks of the bark from April to
  July. The pupa is brownish, thickly powdered with bluish-white, and is
  enclosed in a strong, coarse, cocoon, spun up between leaves.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in August and September, sometimes later, and in
  confinement has emerged in July. It is more abundant in some years than
  in others, and is fond of sitting on walls, pales, etc.; occasionally
  quite large numbers have been observed at rest on telegraph poles by the
  roadside, only one on a pole, as a rule, but sometimes in twos and
  threes. Mr. W. J. Lucas, when at Oxford in August, 1900, counted six on
  one post, and five on each of two other posts.</p>

  <p>The species is found in suitable localities, that is, where poplars
  and willows grow, throughout the south and east of England. The only
  clear record from Ireland is that of a worn specimen at sugar, September
  16, 1906, at Passage West, co. Cork; but Kane mentions two others.</p>

  <p>Represented in North India by var. <i>unicuba</i>, Walker, and in
  Amurland by var. <i>obscurata</i>, Oberthür. <!-- Page 82 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="122.png"><a name="page82"></a>{82}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Dark Crimson Underwing</b> (<i>Catocala sponsa</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species vary in general colour from ashy grey
  to an almost olive brown; the dark clouding is much in evidence in some
  specimens, but absent in others; the white or yellow marks in the
  vicinity of the white outlined reniform are noticeable features. Hind
  wings, crimson, more or less tinged with purple; the upper half of the
  central black band is acutely angled on its outer edge, and bluntly so on
  its inner edge, thence curved to the inner margin. (Plate <a
  href="#plate32">32</a>, Fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greyish-brown with a greenish tinge, and dusted
  with black; paler on the fourth ring and between rings 7 and 8, and 10
  and 11; the hump on ring 8 has an ochreous tip; raised spots, red,
  bearing black bristles; head, pale brown, (Fenn.) It feeds on oak in May
  and June.</p>

  <p>The chrysalis is reddish, dusted with purplish grey, enclosed in a
  rather open silken cocoon between leaves. (Plate <a
  href="#plate33">33</a>, Fig. 1 larva, 1<i>a</i> pupa.) The moth is out in
  July and August. Its chief home is the New Forest, Hants, where it
  abounds, in some years, and in others is so scarce that few specimens can
  be found. It has been taken occasionally in one or other of the southern
  English counties adjoining Hants, and has been noted in Oxfordshire and
  Suffolk; but such occurrences seem to be exceptional.</p>

<h5><b>The Light Crimson Underwing</b> (<i>Catocala promissa</i>).</h5>

  <p>Generally smaller, and the fore wings are usually greyer, than the
  last species; the first black cross line is inwardly shaded with
  blackish; on the hind wings the central black band is straighter, and the
  upper half, although sometimes slightly expanded, is not angled; in some
  examples the band does not quite reach the inner margin, and such
  specimens have been referred to ab. <i>mneste</i>, Hübner. (Plate <a
  href="#plate32">32</a>, Fig. 2.) <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum" title="123.png"
  ><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is of a greenish-tinged greyish coloration, freckled
  with darker grey, and with yellowish brown patches on rings 4, 8, and 9.
  It feeds, at night, on oak, boring into the buds at first, but afterwards
  attacking the foliage: May and June. The moth occurs in oak woods in July
  and August, but it does not seem to be met with anywhere in England so
  frequently as in the New Forest, Hampshire. Even in that favourite
  locality it is seen but rarely in some seasons. It is, or has been, found
  in several other southern and eastern counties, but, as a rule, only in a
  casual way.</p>

<h5><b>The Blackneck</b> (<i>Toxocampa pastinum</i>).</h5>

  <p>In some examples of this species (Plate <a href="#plate32">32</a>,
  Fig. 3) the ground colour of the fore wings, usually pale grey sprinkled
  with brown, is inclined to whitish, and but little powdered with brown,
  except the outer fourth, upon which there is generally some brown
  shading. The reniform stigma varies in shape; in some specimens it is
  lunular, and in others triangular, with the apex directed inwards; the
  orbicular, represented by a black dot, is occasionally absent; the cross
  lines are usually traceable, but the central shade is not often
  distinct.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is rather long, and tapers slightly from the middle
  towards each end. In colour it is greyish, inclining to ochreous on the
  back, and dusted with black; there are three reddish lines along the
  back, the outer ones edged below with white; the spiracles are black, and
  the line along their area is white. It feeds at night on the tufted vetch
  (<i>Vicia cracca</i>), and after hibernation attains full growth about
  May, when it pupates in a cocoon among leaves on the plant, or on the
  ground. The moth comes out in June and July, and in its haunts, which are
  the borders of woods or the clearings therein, it flutters about at early
  dusk, when it can be easily netted. Unlike the species next referred to,
  it does not seem to have any great partiality <!-- Page 84 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="124.png"><a name="page84"></a>{84}</span>for
  flowers, but it has been taken at sugar, and the females are found at
  night upon the food plant. It is known to occur in Berkshire and most of
  the southern counties from Kent to Devon, and eastward from Essex to
  Norfolk, Cambs., and Hunts.; has also been recorded from Yorks.,
  Hereford, and South Wales.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Scarce Blackneck</b> (<i>Toxocampa craccæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate32">32</a>, Fig. 4) is similar to
  the last, but the wings are rather less ample, the tint is slightly more
  brownish, and the veins are paler, especially on the outer area.
  Distinguishing features are the heavier and deeper black collar, and four
  blackish dots on the front edge of the fore wings. Var. <i>plumbea</i>,
  Bankes, the usual form in Cornwall, is darker than the type, having the
  fore wings bluish-grey mixed with chocolate, instead of pale ash-grey
  mixed with light walnut brown; hind wings brownish grey, instead of pale
  greyish brown. The caterpillar, which in shape is similar to that of the
  last species, is ochreous brown, with darker brown lines along the back
  and sides. It feeds at night on the wood vetch (<i>Vicia sylvatica</i>),
  but is said to eat other kinds of vetch in confinement. It may be found
  resting on stems of the food plant by day, or, when feeding at night, by
  the aid of a lantern, but it quickly falls off when disturbed. The moth
  flies at dusk in July and August, and has a strong liking for the flowers
  of the wood-sage, but visits golden-red and other flowers also, and will
  sometimes turn up at the sugar patch. It is not uncommon in some parts of
  the rocky coast of North Devon, as near Lynmouth, where it was first met
  with by the late Rev. E. Horton in 1861. It has since been found commonly
  on the Cornish coast. From what I know of its habits, I should say that
  the species would be found all along the North Devon and Cornish coasts,
  wherever the food plant occurs; but it does not seem to inhabit in any
  other part of Britain. Abroad, its range extends to East Siberia and
  Amurland.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">HYPENINÆ.</h5>

<h5><b>The Beautiful Hook-tip</b> (<i>Laspeyria flexula</i>).</h5>

  <p>Some specimens are browner and others greyer than that shown on Plate
  <a href="#plate36">36</a>, Fig. 1; the pale even lines are generally
  edged with reddish brown, and the notch under the tip of the wing is
  margined with the same colour.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar has the first and second pairs of prolegs very short,
  and below the brown-ringed spiracles there is a projecting ridge, fringed
  with a row of fleshy greenish-white filaments, some of which are forked.
  Bluish-green, sometimes tinged with ochreous; raised dots, black at the
  tips, on a base of whitish green; along the middle of the back is a
  series of darker green spear-points, and beyond this on each side a pale
  line, edged above by a fine wavy black line, and below by a darker green
  line; the eighth and eleventh rings of the body darker than the others.
  (Abridged from description by Buckler.) It feeds on lichens growing upon
  larch, spruce, hawthorn, sloe, fruit trees, etc., from September to May.
  The moth is out in June, July, and August, and may be beaten from the
  branches of trees, and from hedges, but the flushing of a specimen in
  this way is always a more or less casual event. It has been taken on
  several occasions at street lamps, and also in illuminated moth
  traps.</p>

  <p>In England the species seems to be widely distributed over the
  southern counties to Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire; and in the east to
  Norfolk. It has also been recorded from Derbyshire (one), and Yorkshire
  (two).</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland. <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="128.png"><a name="page86"></a>{86}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Waved Black</b> (<i>Parascotia fuliginaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>In the shape of its wings and general appearance the dingy insect
  represented on Plate <a href="#plate36">36</a>, Fig. 2, would seem to
  belong to the Geometridæ rather than to the present group, and, indeed,
  has been mistaken for a dark form of <i>Ematurga atomaria</i>. However,
  the long, projecting palpi are evidence of its being a member of this
  sub-family.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which is moderately stout, and tapers slightly
  towards each end, has only twelve feet. Ground colour, sooty black, with
  orange-coloured raised dots, from which arise long recurved hairs. The
  late Mr. W. H. Tugwell (from whose description of the larva that given
  above has been adapted), in 1884, was shown caterpillars upon a black
  sooty-looking fungus (determined by Dr. M. C. Cooke as an effused
  <i>Muscedine</i>), growing in masses on rotten wood in an old wooden
  building in Bermondsey, near the river. He afterwards reared the
  moths.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar hatches from the egg in August, but it is not full
  grown until May or June, when it spins a fairly compact cocoon of greyish
  silk, which is coated with particles of decayed wood and dried
  fungus.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, and most of the known British
  specimens have been captured in London, or reared from caterpillars found
  therein. Stephens (1831) mentions three or four examples taken during the
  previous thirty years, and gives as localities&mdash;Blackfriars bridge,
  and Little Chelsea; Stainton (1859) adds, Fleet Street. Other specimens
  have been taken in the City in 1855, 1859, 1862, 1870, 1879, and 1881.
  One occurred at Clapham in 1864, and one has been reported from Crome in
  Worcestershire. More recent records are&mdash;one specimen flying around
  a sugared post at Walthamstow, July 29, 1901; eight, chiefly at light, at
  Camberley, 1904-5; and lastly, a specimen at St. Katharine's Docks, July,
  1906. <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum" title="129.png"><a
  name="page87"></a>{87}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Fan-foot</b> (<i>Zanclognatha tarsipennalis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species is shown in both sexes on Plate <a
  href="#plate35">35</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;; it is the
  <i>Pyralis tentaculalis</i> of Haworth, and also that author's
  <i>tarsicrinatus</i>, and the <i>tarsicrinalis</i> of Stephens. The
  general colour is brownish, sometimes inclining to ochreous, and
  occasionally with a greyish cast. The submarginal line starts from the
  front edge, before the tip, of the fore wing.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greyish brown, darker freckled, and dotted with
  black, downy; three broken darker lines along the back, the central one
  broad and inclining to black, and lower down along the sides is a series
  of blackish streaks; head, darker. It feeds in July and August, and
  hibernates when nearly or quite full grown. Among various foods that have
  been mentioned for it are raspberry, ivy, and knotgrass. Some years ago I
  had some moths emerge in the autumn; these resulted from caterpillars
  that I had reared from the egg on blackberry, and I remember that they
  showed a decided preference for the withered leaves left in the cage for
  them to pupate among. (Plate <a href="#plate34">34</a>, Fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, but individuals of a second
  generation seldom occur in the open. Although it occurs in woods, it is
  far more frequent in lanes and hedgerows. Common and generally
  distributed, from Worcester southwards, and to the east and west;
  northwards its range extends to Yorkshire, but it is local and
  uncommon.</p>

  <p>In Scotland it is not scarce in some parts of Ayrshire, and has been
  recorded from Kircudbrightshire. Kane mentions it as fairly common in
  Ireland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland, Corea, and Japan. <!-- Page 88
  --><span class="pagenum" title="130.png"><a
  name="page88"></a>{88}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Small Fan-foot</b> (<i>Zanclognatha grisealis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate35">35</a>, Fig. 3) is somewhat
  similar to the last in colour, but it is smaller, and the submarginal
  line is rather curved, and runs to the tip of the fore wing. The
  caterpillar is obscurely greyish, with a pinkish tinge; three darker
  lines along the back, the central one broadest, but not distinct on the
  first three rings; head, brown, freckled with darker brown, plate of
  first ring of the body, blackish brown. It feeds on oak, and may be
  beaten from the foliage in August and September. Buckler states that this
  species passes the winter in the chrysalis state, and this has been
  confirmed by Plum. (Plate <a href="#plate34">34</a>, Fig. 1; after
  Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>The moths emerge in June and July, and may frequently be dislodged
  from trees, hedges, and undergrowth in the daytime. Pretty generally
  distributed over the southern half of England, plentiful in many parts,
  and widely spread over the northern half of the country. It is not scarce
  in some parts of Wales, but seems to be uncommon in Scotland, and has
  been recorded from the south only. In Ireland it has a wide range, but
  does not appear to be noted as common in any locality.</p>

<h5><b>The Olive Crescent</b> (<i>Zanclognatha</i> (<i>Sophronia</i>) <i>emortualis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The species depicted on Plate <a href="#plate36">36</a>, Fig. 8, from
  a continental specimen, is exceedingly rare in England, in fact, apart
  from the specimens mentioned by early authors, only three authentic
  British examples appear to be known. These are&mdash;one captured at
  Brighton, Sussex, in June, 1858; one in June, 1859, in Epping Forest,
  Essex; and one taken at sugar by the Rev. B. H. Binks, of Stonor,
  Henley-on-Thames, in July of the year last mentioned.</p>

  <p>Stephens (1834), who gives a very unsatisfactory description <!-- Page
  89 --><span class="pagenum" title="131.png"><a
  name="page89"></a>{89}</span>of the species, refers to two specimens, of
  which one was in his collection, from Devonshire. Wood's figure (768) of
  <i>emortualis</i>, in the Westwood edition of the <i>Index
  Entomologicus</i>, does not represent this species, but is far more like
  <i>Herminia derivalis</i>, Hübner.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Lesser Belle</b> (<i>Madopa salicalis</i>).</h5>

  <p>A portrait of this uncommon British moth will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate35">35</a>, Fig. 4. The greyish fore wings are crossed by
  three paler edged reddish-brown lines, the outer one running to the tip
  of the wing, and the inner one is sometimes faint or absent.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is said to feed in July and August on sallow and
  aspen, and is described by Hofmann as having only fourteen feet; green,
  inclining to greyish, in colour, with black spiracles, and the ring
  divisions yellowish. (Plate <a href="#plate39">39</a>, Fig. 3; after
  Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and in its few known localities in
  England it is found in moist woods, hiding among grass and varied
  undergrowth.</p>

  <p>Stephens (1834) wrote, "A very rare and local insect: I have specimens
  taken many years since in the neighbourhood of Bexley, in which vicinity
  I believe my friend Mr. Newman has captured it within these few years; it
  has also been found at Charlton." Since that time other localities in
  Kent have been mentioned, among which were Darenth Wood and West Wickham;
  the species was also noted from Birch wood, Surrey. A specimen was found
  in a gas lamp at Dulwich in 1858 by the late Mr. C. G. Barrett, and one
  was taken in Shooter's Hill wood, Kent, in June, 1859.</p>

  <p>Between 1862 and 1868 specimens were obtained at Haslemere, Surrey,
  and near Sevenoaks, Kent. According to Barrett <!-- Page 90 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="132.png"><a name="page90"></a>{90}</span>it
  occurred at Petersfield, on the borders of Sussex and Hampshire, in
  1877.</p>

  <p>It has also been recorded from Dunham, Cheshire.</p>

  <p>Abroad, its distribution extends to Amurland, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Dotted Fan-foot</b> (<i>Herminia cribrumalis</i> (<i>cribralis</i>)).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate35">35</a>, Fig.
  5) are whitish tinged with brown, inclining to purplish on the outer
  margins; beyond the blackish central dot there are two series of blackish
  dots crossing the wings, but these are not always distinct.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds on various marsh grasses, <i>Carex</i>,
  <i>Luzula</i>, etc., hatches from the egg in late summer, hibernates when
  about half-grown, and feeds up in the spring. It is pale greyish brown
  with fine yellowish freckles; there are three lines along the back; the
  central one dark, finely edged on each side with pale greyish, the outer
  ones pale; the usual dots are dusky and the spiracles are black.</p>

  <p>The moth may be found in June and July in fens and marshes, where it
  hides among the herbage in the daytime, but is easily seen and netted
  when it takes wing at dusk, or sits on the sedges, etc., before or after
  flight.</p>

  <p>It is most frequent in the fens of Cambridge and Norfolk, (Stalham),
  but occurs also in Suffolk; Essex (Shoeburyness); Kent (Deal); Surrey
  (recorded from marshes near Redhill, Dorking and Guildford); Sussex;
  Hants (bogs near Lyndhurst), and, according to Barrett, Somerset.</p>

<h5><b>The Clay Fan-foot</b> (<i>Herminia derivalis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This local species has the wings pretty much of the same shape as
  those of <i>S. emortualis</i>, and has been mistaken for that species;
  but the colour is ochreous-brown, and the cross lines <!-- Page 91
  --><span class="pagenum" title="133.png"><a
  name="page91"></a>{91}</span>are dark brown. Its favourite haunts appear
  to be woods in Kent and Sussex, and in the last-named county it is
  perhaps most frequently met with in Abbots wood, Guestling, and Lewes. It
  has also been recorded from Essex (Colchester). (Plate <a
  href="#plate35">35</a>, Fig. 6.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds on dead oak leaves, chiefly those that have
  fallen to the ground. After hibernation it becomes full grown about June,
  and is then brown with a downy appearance; there are three faintly darker
  lines along the back, and the usual dots are dusky. (Plate <a
  href="#plate34">34</a>, Fig. 3; after Hofmann.) The moth is out in June
  and July, and in the daytime may be put up from its lurking place among
  herbage in wood clearings, or netted as it flies in the gloaming. It is
  also attracted by sugar and light.</p>

  <p>The species has been erroneously recorded from Chester and Barmouth
  (North Wales); and Mr. Carr informs me that he is not quite sure that a
  specimen he recorded from Dawlish, South Devon, was correctly identified.
  In the catalogue of Malvern Lepidoptera <i>H. derivalis</i> is stated to
  be rather common in that district, but the occurrence of the species in
  the Midlands requires confirmation.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Common Fan-foot</b> (<i>Pechipogon barbalis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of the species shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate35">35</a>, Fig. 7, are greyish brown, crossed by three
  darker lines, the outer one almost parallel with the hind margin, and
  edged with whitish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds on the dead leaves of oak and birch, and has
  almost attained full growth when it retires for the winter. In the spring
  it has been known to eat birch catkins. The general colour is reddish
  ochreous, with diamond-shaped markings, forming a series along the back
  and two series along each side. <!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum" title="134.png"
  ><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span></p>

  <p>The moth, which is out from late May until early July, frequents the
  more open parts of woods, and in the daytime may be induced to show
  itself by tapping the lower branches of trees or brushing the bushes and
  undergrowth as we pass along.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed over England, from Staffordshire
  southwards, but it is apparently most frequently met with in some of the
  woods of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Beautiful Snout</b> (<i>Bomolocha fontis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The portraits of this species on Plate <a href="#plate35">35</a> show
  each sex in its most usual form: Fig. 8 representing the male, and Fig. 9
  the female. The outer and inner areas of the fore wings are generally
  ashy grey, more or less brownish tinged, in the male; and the same parts
  are whitish in the female. Although some examples of the male have the
  outer and inner areas whitish, as in the female, they can be
  distinguished by their darker hind wings and the blackish central
  crescent thereon. A form of the female in which the large central patch
  of the fore wings is reddish brown has been named <i>rufescens</i>, Tutt;
  there may be males also of this form, but I have not seen any. In both
  sexes, the brown patch extends nearer to the inner margin in some
  specimens than in others, and not infrequently there is a spur from the
  lower edge of the patch to this margin.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with darker green lines, one along the
  middle of the back, and two along each side; the usual raised dots are
  green or brownish, and each emits a fine hair; the head is green and
  rather glossy. It feeds on bilberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>) in
  August and September. (Plate <a href="#plate37">37</a>, Fig. 1; after
  Hofmann.) The moth, which is out in June and July, hides by day among
  heather, bilberry, etc., especially where these plants overhang the edges
  of banks or trenches. It may be found locally in most of the southern
  counties of England from Kent to Cornwall; also in Berks, Stafford, and
  Leicester. It has been recorded from Suffolk, Worcester, Cheshire (one at
  electric light, Chester, July, 1900), and North Wales. In Ireland it is
  widely distributed, and is not uncommon in Co. Kerry.</p>

<h5><b>The Snout</b> (<i>Hypena proboscidalis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate35">35</a>, Fig. 10) is more
  generally distributed and common than any other of the group. Wherever
  nettles grow in quantity there we may expect to find this moth in its
  season, that is, in June and July. In favourable years there is sometimes
  a second flight, on a small scale, in the autumn; this was the case in
  1905.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with raised dots, from each of which a
  brownish hair arises; the line along the middle of the back is dark, and
  those along the sides are yellowish; the head is ochreous brown. It feeds
  on nettles in May and June. (Plate <a href="#plate37">37</a>, Fig. 3;
  after Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>In Amurland, and some other parts of eastern Asia, the species is
  represented by the brown-sprinkled yellowish form, var. <i>deleta</i>,
  Staudinger.</p>

<h5><b>The Bloxworth Snout</b> (<i>Hypena obsitalis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species are brown, crossed by a number of
  darker lines and a thicker angulated line beyond the middle; the latter
  is outwardly edged with pale brown, chiefly towards the costa; some white
  dots on the veins represent the submarginal line, and below the tips of
  the wings there are some black streaks.</p>

  <p>One example of this form of the species, which is a variable one, was
  taken by the Rev. O. Pickard, Cambridge, in <!-- Page 94 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="138.png"><a
  name="page94"></a>{94}</span>September, 1884. He found it sitting on a
  door-jamb in his garden at Bloxworth, Dorset.</p>

  <p>The specimen shown on Plate <a href="#plate36">36</a>, Fig. 9, hails
  from Mogador.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range of the species includes southern Europe, Asia Minor,
  Egypt, North-West Africa, Madeira, and the Canaries.</p>

<h5><b>The Buttoned Snout</b> (<i>Hypena rostralis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two forms of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate35">35</a>. The typical one is represented by Fig. 12, and
  Fig. 11 shows ab. <i>palpalis</i>, Tutt (?), Fabr. and Stephens. The
  front margin of the fore wings is often streaked with a pale colour, and
  in ab. <i>radiatalis</i>, Hübner (134), which is otherwise similar to the
  last-named form, this is pale or ochreous brown. A uniform pale greyish
  form has been named ab. <i>unicolor</i>, Tutt, and one almost entirely
  ochreous or greyish-ochreous, ab. <i>ochrea</i>, Tutt.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with blackish dots; a darker line along the
  middle of the back, and white lines along the sides; head, yellowish
  green dotted with black. It feeds on hop (<i>Humulus lupulus</i>) in June
  and early July, and in the daytime may be found on the undersides of the
  leaves. (Plate <a href="#plate37">37</a>, Fig. 2; after Hofmann.) The
  moth is out in August and September, and after hibernation reappears in
  the spring, and may be met with until June. It may be obtained at sugar,
  or at ivy bloom. Given the food plant, the species will probably be found
  in most of the counties of England from Worcester southwards, but its
  occurrence northwards appears to have been very rarely noted.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to East Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>The White-line Snout</b> (<i>Hypenodes tænialis</i> (<i>albistrigalis</i>)).</h5>

  <p>This species, and also the two immediately following, are so small in
  size, and so obscure in appearance, that they are <!-- Page 95 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="139.png"><a name="page95"></a>{95}</span>probably
  more often neglected than secured when met with. The moth under
  consideration, and of which the sexes are figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate36">36</a> (Figs. 3 &#x2642; and 4 &#x2640;) has brownish
  fore wings which are crossed by two rather irregular blackish lines,
  sometimes hardly traceable on the front margin; the outer line is edged
  externally with whitish, and the space between the lines is often
  somewhat darker; the black central mark is more or less X-shaped.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar does not seem to have been noted in this country, and
  it is not well known on the continent. It is said to feed on the flowers,
  chiefly the withering ones, of heather and thyme, in August and
  September.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and early August, sometimes in September. Its
  haunts are the edges of woods, hillsides, and sloping banks, where there
  is plenty of bushes and herbage to hide in. From such retreats it may be
  disturbed, but is more easily obtained at sugar, or honey dew, and
  sometimes at ivy bloom. It is widely distributed over the southern half
  of England; occurs in South Wales, and has been recorded from Cheshire
  and Yorks.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the species is found in Holland, Belgium, Germany, Austria,
  Armenia, and the Canaries; also recorded from south Sweden and Corea.</p>

<h5><b>The Pinion-streaked Snout</b> (<i>Hypenodes costæstrigalis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Although somewhat similar in the general colour of the forewings, this
  species (Plate <a href="#plate36">36</a>) may be distinguished from the
  preceding by the whitish dash from the tips of the wings and the black
  streak running inwards from it; this black streak is to be seen clearly
  in Fig. 6 &#x2642;, but owing to the darker ground colour is less
  distinct in Fig. 7 &#x2640;.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is shining purplish-brown, inclining to
  yellowish-brown below, with three pale brownish lines along <!-- Page 96
  --><span class="pagenum" title="140.png"><a
  name="page96"></a>{96}</span>the back, the central one rather broad, and
  that on each side is edged below with dusky. What the food may be in a
  natural state has not been ascertained, but the caterpillars have been
  reared from the egg on a diet of thyme flowers, supplemented by the
  bodies of a few brothers or sisters. July and August.</p>

  <p>The moth has been noted in June (end), July, August, September, and
  October; but whether there are two generations or only one in the year is
  not definitely known; the assumption is that there are two.</p>

  <p>This species is partial to moist localities, and its favourite haunts
  are fens, mosses, or marshy heaths, and the outskirts of damp woods. It
  ranges over the greater part of England, and is found in Wales
  (Pembrokeshire). In Scotland it has been noted from Roxburghshire, and is
  locally common in Clydesdale. It is known to occur in Cork, Kerry, and
  Sligo, and probably is to be found in other parts of Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Marsh Oblique-barred</b> (<i>Tholomiges turfosalis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The species shown on Plate <a href="#plate36">36</a>, Fig. 5, is much
  smaller than either of the last two. The narrow fore wings are
  whitish-ochreous, more or less thickly sprinkled with brown; the first of
  the three dark cross lines is often indistinct, the second is bent under
  the black central dot, and the third runs obliquely to the tip of the
  wing; the last two are each outwardly edged with whitish.</p>

  <p>Nothing seems to be known of the early stages.</p>

  <p>This species was first made known as an inhabitant of the British
  Isles by Doubleday, who described it as <i>Hypenodes humidalis</i>, in
  1850, from specimens taken in Ireland by Weaver in 1848. In 1850 it was
  found plentifully on one of the Cheshire moors; and Harrison, in <i>The
  Zoologist</i> for 1851, writes: "From the middle of July up to the 8th of
  August, it might be seen any fine evening, between the hours of six and
  eight, flying on most of our swamps [Keswick] in plenty." He goes on to
  state that the moths were so common that he boxed forty in less than an
  hour, and could have secured as many dozens. At the present day the
  species is to be found on boggy heaths and moors in Surrey, Hampshire,
  Dorset, and from Somerset through Gloucestershire into Berkshire, and
  thence northwards through Warwick and Staffordshire to Cheshire,
  Lancashire, and Cumberland. Barrett mentions Perthshire as a Scottish
  locality, and Kane states that it is common at Killarney in Ireland. When
  this species and its allies receive more of the collector's attention
  they may probably be found in many localities from which there are no
  records at present.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5 class="lg150">BREPHIDÆ.</h5>

  <p>By some systematists this small group of moths is treated as a
  subfamily of the Geometridæ. <i>Brephos</i>, however, which is typical of
  the family, does not seem to have any close affinities with the Noctuidæ
  or with the Geometers, and is therefore better considered as apart from
  both those families. Meyrick includes <i>Brephos</i> with <i>Aplasta</i>,
  <i>Erannis</i>, and <i>Baptria</i>, in his family Monocteniadæ.</p>

  <p>Only five species are known to inhabit the Palæarctic Region, and two
  of these occur in Britain.</p>

<h5><b>The Orange Underwing</b> (<i>Brephos parthenias</i>).</h5>

  <p>The white markings of the fore wings vary a good deal in size; in some
  specimens, chiefly males, they are very small and confined to the front
  margin; in others, mainly females, they are much enlarged, and the
  central one is continued as a band across the wings. On the orange hind
  wings the blackish <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum" title="144.png"
  ><a name="page98"></a>{98}</span>central band is usually more or less
  complete, but sometimes it is nearly or quite absent above the blackish
  triangular patch on the inner margin. Occasionally, there is a yellow
  blotch at the anal angle, and frequently another on the costal area.
  Still more rarely the whole ground colour is yellow. (Figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate38">38</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642; and 2 &#x2640;.) The caterpillar
  is green, with six white lines along the back, and white stripes along
  the sides. When young it feeds on the catkins of birch, and afterwards on
  the foliage. April to early June. (Plate <a href="#plate39">39</a>, Fig.
  1.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in March and April, and on sunny days the males may be
  seen flying, generally pretty high up, on the lee side of the birch trees
  growing on heaths; also in open spaces in or around birch woods. The
  females rest on the twigs, as also do the males when the sun is obscured.
  Both sexes have been found sitting on the ground in sunny glades.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed over the southern and eastern
  counties, common in many parts; but its range extends through England to
  Durham, and it has been recorded from Wales. Although it does not seem to
  have been noted in Scotland south of Kincardineshire, it occurs on the
  east to Moray. Westmeath is the only Irish locality that has so far been
  mentioned.</p>

  <p>Its distribution abroad extends to East Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Light Orange Underwing</b> (<i>Brephos notha</i>).</h5>

  <p>Very similar to the last species, but rather smaller in size, and the
  fore wings are much less variegated. The antennæ of the male of this
  species are bipectinated, whilst those of <i>parthenias</i> are finely
  serrated. (Plate <a href="#plate38">38</a>, Figs. 4 &#x2642; and 5
  &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds in May and June on aspen, eating the foliage and
  hiding between two leaves drawn together. The head is greenish or
  greenish-brown, with three conspicuous black spots. Body, green,
  olive-green, or reddish; line along middle of the back darker green edged
  with white; two thin white lines on each side, and a whitish stripe along
  the spiracles. When mature it burrows into decayed bark or wood (virgin
  cork in confinement), and before changing to a reddish-brown chrysalis,
  it spins a thin covering of silk and woody particles over the mouth of
  the chamber. The caterpillar and the chrysalis are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate39">39</a>, Figs. 2 and 2<i>a</i>. Although the bulk of the
  moths emerge the following April, some have been known to remain until
  the following or even the third year. The males fly about aspen, but only
  in the sunshine; in other respects its habits are pretty much those of
  the last species.</p>

  <p>The distribution of the species in England seems confined to two
  areas: a western one represented by Worcester, Gloucester, with Monmouth,
  Wales, Wilts, and Dorset; and an eastern one by Norfolk, Cambridgeshire,
  Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, and Sussex. In Scotland only
  recorded from Moray.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5 class="lg150">GEOMETRIDÆ.</h5>

  <p>Caterpillars of this family of moths, with very few exceptions, have
  only two pairs of claspers or prolegs; when there are more than four
  claspers, the extra ones are only rudimentary and therefore useless. In
  moving from place to place the caterpillar stretches out to its full
  length, first to one side and then to the other, as though measuring the
  distance. When a hold is secured with the true legs the body is arched
  and the claspers are brought up almost to the point held by the true
  legs; the latter are then thrust forward and the measuring business
  proceeds as before. Some kinds perform the looping man&oelig;uvre very
  deliberately, but others at a quick rate. In common parlance among
  British entomologists the caterpillars are called <!-- Page 100 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="148.png"><a
  name="page100"></a>{100}</span>"geometers" or "loopers," but to our
  American confrères they are known as "measuring-worms" or
  "span-worms."</p>

  <p>Most of the caterpillars feed openly on the foliage of trees, shrubs,
  or low-growing herbs, and the majority remain upon their respective
  plants during the day.</p>

  <p>A large proportion of the moths may be obtained in the daytime, either
  by beating or otherwise disturbing the foliage or herbage among which
  they hide; several kinds rest on tree trunks, palings, rocks, walls,
  etc., where they are sometimes conspicuous, but more frequently not easy
  to distinguish from their surroundings. On the whole, members of this
  family are more available to the day collector than are those of the
  Noctuidæ. Although several species occasionally visit the sugar patch,
  such species are, as a rule, obtained more readily and in larger numbers
  by other methods. Brilliant light has a great attraction for many of the
  moths, some are more often captured at gas or electric lamps than in any
  other way, and among these are the migratory species.</p>

  <p>Staudinger divides the family into the following
  subfamilies:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Geometrinæ (= Geometridæ, Meyrick).</p>
      <p>Acidaliinæ (= Sterrhidæ, Meyrick).</p>
      <p>Larentiinæ (= Hydriomenidæ, Meyrick).</p>
      <p>Orthostixinæ (not represented in Britain).</p>
      <p>Boarmiinæ (= Selidosemidæ, Meyrick).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Except as regards the Larentiinæ, I have largely adhered to
  Staudinger's arrangement of genera in each of the above subfamilies.</p>

  <p>The typical genus of Larentiinæ would be <i>Larentia</i>, Treit, to
  which something over two hundred species are referred by Staudinger,
  among which are upwards of sixty that occur in the British Isles.
  Following some of the later generic changes, I find that none of our
  species are left in <i>Larentia</i>, but a few fall into
  <i>Hydriomena</i>, Hübner, and therefore Hydriomeninæ has been adopted
  for this subfamily. <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum" title="149.png"
  ><a name="page101"></a>{101}</span></p>

<h5 class="lg125">GEOMETRINÆ.</h5>

<h5><b>The Rest Harrow</b> (<i>Aplasta ononaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This greyish-brown moth has two darker, sometimes reddish, cross lines
  on the fore wings, and one such line on the hind wings. It is presumably
  only to be regarded as an accidental visitor to England. The first record
  was of a specimen captured in the Warren at Folkestone in July, 1866, and
  since that year others were obtained in the same locality, but apparently
  not more than about half a dozen altogether. None seems to have been
  recorded for over thirty-five years. The specimen, whose portrait is
  shown on Plate <a href="#plate38">38</a>, Fig. 3, was obtained from
  Dresden.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range includes Central and Southern Europe, Asia Minor,
  Syria, and Armenia.</p>

<h5><b>The Grass Emerald</b> (<i>Pseudoterpna pruinata</i>).</h5>

  <p>When freshly emerged from the chrysalis, the species represented by
  Figs. 6 to 8 on Plate <a href="#plate38">38</a> is of a beautiful
  blue-green colour, but in course of time a greyish shade creeps over the
  wings. The dark cross lines vary in intensity; in some specimens well
  defined and blackish, in others very faint, and hardly discernible;
  occasionally, the space between the lines on the fore wings is dark
  shaded; the whitish submarginal line is not always present. This species
  is the <i>cythisaria</i> of Schiffermiller, and the <i>cytisaria</i> of
  other authors.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (figured on Plate <a href="#plate41">41</a>, Fig. 1,
  from a coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich) is green, with three lines along
  the back, the central one dark green, the others whitish; a pinkish
  stripe low down along the sides, the points on the head and the first and
  last rings of the body are often pink also. It feeds on pettywhin
  (<i>Genista anglica</i>), also on broom (<i>Cytisus scoparius</i>) <!--
  Page 102 --><span class="pagenum" title="150.png"><a
  name="page102"></a>{102}</span>and gorse (<i>Ulex</i>); in captivity it
  seems to thrive on laburnum. Most frequently obtained in the springtime
  after hibernation.</p>

  <p>The moth is to be found in June and July on moorlands and commons
  pretty well throughout the British Isles, but it seems not to have been
  noted north of Perthshire, in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Odd specimens have been known to occur in late August or early
  September, but this is quite exceptional.</p>

<h5><b>The Large Emerald</b> (<i>Geometra papilionaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This charming green species (Plate <a href="#plate40">40</a>, Figs. 1
  and 4) varies in tint and in the distinctness of the whitish wavy cross
  lines. In some examples, one or other of the lines is absent, and far
  more rarely there is but little trace of any of these markings.
  Occasionally, the discal mark is preceded by a whitish wedge-shaped spot
  on the fore wings (ab. <i>cuneata</i>, Burrows).</p>

  <p>When newly laid the eggs are whitish, but soon change to greenish
  yellow, and finally to pinkish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar hatches in late summer, and feeds on birch, hazel, and
  beech, until the leaves begin to fall in the autumn; it then constructs a
  carpet of silk on a twig, and near a bud, upon which it takes up its
  position for the winter. When thus seen, its reddish brown colour,
  variegated more or less with green, assimilates so closely with its
  surroundings that the creature is not easy to detect. In the spring, when
  it awakens, the green colour increases in extent as the buds open and the
  leaves unfold; when they are fully expanded, the caterpillar sits among
  the foliage towards the tip of a twig, and is then almost entirely green,
  the reddish brown only showing on the head, slightly on the warts, and
  more distinctly on the hinder parts which are in touch with the twig. The
  chrysalis, enclosed in a flimsy silken web among the dead leaves, usually
  on the ground, is of a delicate green colour, dotted with buff on the
  back, and shaded with buff on the wing cases. The early stages are
  figured on Plate <a href="#plate42">42</a>.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, and may occasionally be beaten out
  of a hedge or bush, but is most frequently obtained late at night, when
  it is active on the wing, and is attracted by a brilliant light.</p>

  <p>The species occurs in woods, on heaths and moors, and in fens,
  throughout the British Isles, except the most northern parts of Scotland
  and the isles.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Emerald</b> (<i>Geometra vernaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate40">40</a>, Figs. 2 and 3) is
  smaller than the last mentioned, the green colour is of a softer tint,
  and the lines crossing the wings, two on the fore wings and one on the
  hind wings, are whitish, and not waved.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar hatches from the egg in August, and after hibernation
  is to be found in May and June on Traveller's Joy or Old Man's Beard
  (<i>Clematis vitalba</i>). It is then green, with white dots arranged in
  lines along the back and sides; the head is deep reddish brown, and this,
  and also the first and last rings of the body, have raised points.
  Transformation to the greenish chrysalis is effected among the leaves,
  drawn together with silk. (Plate <a href="#plate44">44</a>, Figs. 3 and
  3<i>a</i>.)</p>

  <p>The moth flies in the evening in July and August, and in the daytime
  may be disturbed, by the application of the beating stick, from its
  retreats in hedges, etc., where the food plant flourishes. Found in most
  of the southern and eastern counties of England, most frequently on the
  chalk; its range extends to Worcestershire. Except that it has been
  recorded as a doubtful inhabitant of Ireland, the species does not appear
  to occur elsewhere in the British Isles. The distribution abroad extends
  to Amurland. <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum" title="154.png"><a
  name="page104"></a>{104}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Blotched Emerald</b> (<i>Euchloris</i> (<i>Comibæna</i>) <i>pustulata</i>).</h5>

  <p>When quite fresh, this moth (Plate <a href="#plate43">43</a>, Fig. 1)
  is exceedingly pretty; the pale blotches vary a little in size, as also
  do the reddish marks upon them.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar adorns itself with particles of its food as soon as it
  leaves the egg in July; after hibernation it uses the scales or husks of
  the oak buds for the same purpose. When stripped of its trappings it is
  found to be reddish brown in colour, with three slightly darker lines
  along the back; hooded bristles arising from raised brownish spots afford
  means for the attachment of the masquerading outfit, each moiety of which
  is covered with silk on one side before being placed in the required
  position. When beating oaks for larvæ in May and June, the contents of
  the umbrella or beating tray should not be too hastily thrown away, but
  allowed to remain therein for awhile, and closely watched for any
  movement among the litter. The spectacle of a cluster of oak bracts
  suddenly becoming active will certainly arouse curiosity, and on
  examination the cause of the commotion will frequently be found to be the
  caterpillar of this species. (Plate <a href="#plate41">41</a>, Fig. 2;
  after Auld.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, and flies at dusk in and around oak
  woods. In the daytime it may be jarred from its perch in oak trees, and
  once I found a specimen on a fence in the Esher district. It has been
  known to visit light, and examples of a September emergence have been
  recorded.</p>

  <p>As a British species it only inhabits England, and it has been noted
  from Staffordshire and Leicester, but seems to be rare in the midland
  counties generally. It is more frequently found in the southern and
  eastern counties.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends through Central Europe to Southern Sweden,
  S. Russia, N. Asia Minor, and Andalusia. <!-- Page 105 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="155.png"><a name="page105"></a>{105}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Essex Emerald</b> (<i>Euchloris smaragdaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>In some examples of this species (Plate <a href="#plate43">43</a>,
  Figs. 2, 3) the green colour is brighter than in others, and very
  occasionally it is tinged with bluish; typically, there are white cross
  lines on the fore wings, but the inner one is not infrequently absent,
  and more rarely both are missing. The white central spot is very rarely
  absent, and the edges of the fore wings are yellowish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds on the sea wormwood (<i>Artemisia maritima</i>),
  and adorns itself with fragments of its food plant in much the same
  manner as that of the species last referred to. Although obtained in the
  autumn in some numbers from its food plant, it seems to have been rarely
  met with in the spring after hibernation. It is, therefore, advisable to
  collect the caterpillars about September, and transfer them to plants of
  the garden <i>Artemisia abrotanum</i>, locally known as "Southernwood,"
  "Old man," or "Lad's love," or, where available, wormwood (<i>A.
  absinthium</i>) will suit it admirably. Upon either of these plants the
  larvæ will hibernate, feed up in the spring, and become full grown about
  May. The early stages are figured on Plate <a href="#plate42">42</a>,
  larva and pupa from photos by Mr. H. Main.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and early July, but it is rarely seen in the
  open, although over sixty years ago a few specimens were put up from
  among grass and netted at St. Osyth; in later years an example or two
  have been taken at Sheerness in Kent. Possibly, others may also have been
  captured in one or other of the insect's haunts, but records are silent
  on the matter. Barrett mentions a specimen emerging in September, and the
  Rev. C. R. N. Burrows notes that part of a brood of caterpillars reared
  from eggs, and fed on <i>A. absinthium</i>, attained the moth state
  during the autumn. So far as concerns <!-- Page 106 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="156.png"><a name="page106"></a>{106}</span>the
  British Isles it seems to be almost exclusively an inhabitant of the
  salterns, or sea marshes of Essex.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the species occurs inland, and is not confined to the coast;
  its range extends eastwards to Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Grass Emerald</b> (<i>Nemoria viridata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species, represented on Plate <a href="#plate43">43</a>, Figs. 5
  and 6, is readily distinguished by its small size and the well-defined
  white cross line on each wing. In most examples there is a more or less
  distinct whitish inner line on the fore wings. Ab. <i>mathewi</i>,
  Bankes, has all the wings dusted with orange scales, more especially on
  the outer marginal areas. A few examples of this form were reared in
  1905, with a number of normal specimens, from eggs laid by a female
  captured in South Devonshire.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (figured from a skin on Plate <a
  href="#plate44">44</a>, Fig. 1) is green, roughened with whitish points;
  a dusky line along the middle of the back, marked on the front and end
  rings, also between the rings, with purplish red. Head, and first ring of
  the body, notched, the points reddish; last ring of the body pointed.
  When at rest on a twig it assumes a rigid posture, and the legs are
  tightly drawn together. It feeds on heather, sallow, and birch, but the
  general experience appears to be that in captivity it thrives best on a
  diet of hawthorn, and is especially partial to the young shoots. It may
  be obtained in July and August, and the moth comes out in the following
  May or June. In 1905, Mr. A. J. Scollick reared some caterpillars from
  eggs laid June 2nd, and hatched June 16th; all duly pupated, and a moth
  came up on December 20th of that year. Four others appeared in January
  and February, 1906.</p>

  <p>The Rev. F. E. Lowe states that in Guernsey the species occurs
  exclusively among furze on cliffs by the sea, and chiefly where the plant
  is cut down from time to time. In Britain it inhabits heaths and mosses,
  but is very local. It is found in the English counties of Hants (New
  Forest, etc.), Dorset (Poole Heath, etc.), Devon (Woodbury, Exeter
  district, etc.), Norfolk (Horning), Worcester (Malvern district, rare);
  also at Methop, Witherslack, and other localities in Westmoreland and
  Cumberland. Only doubtfully recorded from Scotland and Ireland.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland, Corea, and China.</p>

<h5><b>The Little Emerald</b> (<i>Iodis lactearia</i>).</h5>

  <p>The green tint in this species (Plate <a href="#plate43">43</a>, Figs.
  4 and 7) is even more unstable than in others of the group. When quite
  fresh the wings can often only be described as whitish with a delicate
  green tinge, but even when the greatest care is taken to preserve it, the
  colour is apt to fade.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate44">44</a>, Fig. 2, from a
  coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich) is long and thin, with two points on the
  edge of the first ring, and one on the last ring, of a bright green
  colour, paler between the rings; the spots along the back are reddish, as
  also is the whitish-fronted deeply notched head. It feeds on the leaves
  of various trees and bushes, such as birch, oak, hawthorn, sallow, etc.
  It may be obtained by beating or searching from August to September.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, in some seasons later, and may be
  beaten out of hedges, as well as from trees in woods. Generally
  distributed, and often common, throughout England, Wales, and Ireland. In
  Scotland it is locally common in Clydesdale, and occurs in other southern
  parts of that country.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland, Corea, China, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Common Emerald</b> (<i>Hemithea strigata</i>).</h5>

  <p>When freshly emerged from the chrysalis, this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate43">43</a>, Figs. 8 and 9) is darkish green, but it soon
  fades to a greyish <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum" title="160.png"
  ><a name="page108"></a>{108}</span>tint. Easily distinguished by its
  shape, and by the chequered fringes. It is the <i>æstivaria</i> of
  Hübner, and <i>thymiaria</i> of Guenée. The long, thin, green caterpillar
  is ornamented with reddish brown, the V-shaped marks on rings 5 to 8 are
  sometimes whitish; head, deeply notched, brown; the first ring of the
  body is also notched. It hatches from the egg in August, when it is said
  to feed on mugwort (<i>Artemisia vulgaris</i>), and other low plants;
  after hibernation it feeds on the foliage of oak, birch, hawthorn, rose,
  etc., and attains full growth in May or June. In late June and in July
  the moth may be put up from the undergrowth in woods, or from bushes in
  well-timbered hedgerows bordering lanes and fields. Specimens so obtained
  are poor in colour as a rule, and it is well, therefore, to rear the
  species from the caterpillar. (Plate <a href="#plate41">41</a>, Fig. 3;
  after Hofmann.) This remark applies to all "Emeralds."</p>

  <p>The species is often common in the south and east of England, and
  along the western side, including Wales, up to Cheshire and Lancashire,
  but it becomes local in Worcestershire and northwards. There are few
  records of it from Yorkshire, and its occurrence in Durham,
  Northumberland, and Scotland is doubtful. In Ireland it appears to be
  widely distributed, but scarce.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland, Corea, and Japan.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>[<i>Thalera fimbrialis</i>. A specimen of this Central European
  species (identified by the late Mr. C. G. Barrett) was taken on August 7,
  1902, by Mr. C. Capper, from a blade of grass growing on a slope under
  Beachy Head, Sussex. The species is somewhat similar in appearance to
  <i>H. strigata</i>, but is larger; the hind wings are notched above the
  angle on the outer margin; the fringes of all the wings are chequered
  with red, and the antennæ of the male are bipectinated.] <!-- Page 109
  --><span class="pagenum" title="161.png"><a
  name="page109"></a>{109}</span></p>

<h5 class="lg125">ACIDALIINÆ.</h5>

<h5><b>Purple-bordered Gold</b> (<i>Hyria muricata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two forms of this pretty little species (known also as
  <i>auroraria</i>) are shown on Plate <a href="#plate45">45</a>. Fig. 1
  represents the more usual form, but between this and the almost entirely
  purple variety (Fig. 4), which occurs chiefly in the north, there are
  various modifications. Then again, especially in the south of England,
  there is a tendency to become entirely yellow, the purple, inclining to
  crimson in such specimens, being confined to the front margin and cross
  lines on the fore wings, and a narrow band on the outer margin of all the
  wings.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale brownish, inclining to ochreous at each end,
  marked with irregular blackish lines on the back, and dots and streaks on
  the sides. Its natural food plant seems to be unknown, but when reared
  from the egg the caterpillar will eat knotgrass, and sometimes a few will
  feed up and attain the moth state the same year. August to May.</p>

  <p>The moth occurs in late June and in July, and frequents fens, boggy
  heaths, and mosses. Although odd specimens may, occasionally, be flushed
  during the day, the collector will need to be up early in the morning if
  he would see this species on the wing, as it seems to fly most freely
  about sunrise. The New Forest in Hampshire is a noted district for it, as
  also are Ranworth, Horning, etc., in Norfolk, and Witherslack in
  Westmoreland. In Ireland, it is found in counties Galway, Kerry, and
  Mayo.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland, China, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Weaver's Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>contiguaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The earliest known British specimen of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate45">45</a>, Figs. 2 and 5) was taken in North Wales by
  Weaver, in 1855, <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum" title="162.png"
  ><a name="page110"></a>{110}</span>and was figured and described in
  <i>The Entomologist's Annual</i> for 1856 as <i>Dosithea eburnata</i>,
  Wocke. About seven years later Greening captured a female specimen, and
  he subsequently reared the insect, when it became known as "Greening's
  Pug." Still later, about 1875, the English name was changed to "Capper's
  Acidalia."</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the species seems not difficult to rear from the egg,
  otherwise specimens in collections would be not only very limited in
  number, but frequently very indifferent in condition.</p>

  <p>In colour the moth is whity brown, more or less dusted or clouded with
  dark grey; except in the darker forms, three irregular black lines on the
  fore wings, and two on the hind wings, are clearly seen. It flies at dusk
  in June and July, and sits by day on lichen-covered rocks.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale ochreous brown, with irregular dark brown
  lines. It feeds on ling (<i>Calluna</i>) and crowberry (<i>Empetrum</i>)
  from September to May; but when eggs are obtained, the caterpillar
  hatching from them may be kept on chickweed, knotgrass, etc., and the
  moth be reared the same year.</p>

  <p>Mr. R. Tait records the finding of ten caterpillars on navelwort
  (<i>Cotyledon</i>) growing among heather in a very sheltered corner among
  rocks in North Wales, at Easter, 1906. He also notes that moths reared in
  captivity pair readily.</p>

  <p>The British localities, all in North Wales, are Aber, Bangor,
  Barmouth, Bettws-y-coed, Conway, Dolgelly, Lanfairfechan, and
  Penmaenmawr.</p>

<h5><b>The Least Carpet</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>rusticata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The whitish fore wings of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate45">45</a>, Figs. 3 and 6) are crossed by a blackish central
  band, and there is a blackish patch at the base of the wings, with an
  extension along the front margin, almost or quite to the central band;
  the hind wings have a central dot, and three or four dark grey wavy
  lines, the space between the first and second darkened, and appearing to
  be a continuation of the fore wing band. The thick set, pale
  ochreous-brown, or grey-brown, caterpillar (Plate <a
  href="#plate48">48</a>, Fig. 1, drawn from a skin) has three more or less
  distinct pale lines along the back, and a series of darker diamonds along
  the central area; head, brown. In the open, its food probably consists of
  decaying or withered leaves, but when treated in captivity it will eat
  and thrive upon growing knotgrass, groundsel, dandelion, etc. August to
  May. Mr. Mera mentions that some caterpillars he reared on dandelion
  produced moths that were larger in size than most captured specimens.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July, and specimens have been bred in September
  from eggs laid in July of the same year. To obtain this species, a
  journey will have to be made to one or other of its special haunts in
  Kent, lying between Greenhithe and Sheerness. Other localities from which
  it has been recorded are Kingsdown, Dover, Folkestone (Kent); Brighton,
  Lewes, West Horsham (Sussex); Isle of Portland (Dorset); Rame Head,
  Torquay (Devon); and single specimens have been reported from Stowmarket
  and Felixstowe (Suffolk).</p>

<h5><b>The Rusty Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>herbariata</i>).</h5>

  <p>In <i>The Entomologists Annual</i> for 1856, two species of
  <i>Acidalia</i> were brought forward as new to the British list. One of
  these has been referred to under <i>A. contiguaria</i>, the other was the
  present species, which at the time was wrongly referred to
  <i>circuitaria</i>, Hübner. The specimens depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate45">45</a>, Figs. 7 and 10, are of continental origin.</p>

  <p>Although other specimens were then known to exist in at least two
  British collections, the first recorded example was that mentioned above.
  This was captured in Bloomsbury Street, <!-- Page 112 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="166.png"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span>London.
  In June, 1868, three or four examples were found in a herbalist's shop in
  Holborn; one occurred on a shop window in Oxford Street in 1873; one
  example was taken from a door-post in Cannon Street, July 21, 1879; and
  two others have been noted from the same street, but dates were not
  given. The latest record, that of a specimen on July 21, 1898, in a shop
  in Southampton Row, Bloomsbury, closes the list; it then appears that all
  the British specimens known to us have been taken in London.</p>

  <p>The eggs are laid on dry or withered plants, upon which the long
  brownish or greenish caterpillars feed throughout the autumn, winter, and
  following spring. They pupate towards mid-May, and the moths appear in
  June and July. According to Guenée, caterpillars seem to have been found
  only in herb or drug stores, and the moths occur in gardens and houses in
  July and August.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Dusty Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>virgularia</i>).</h5>

  <p>In most parts of the southern half of England this species, of which
  three specimens are shown on Plate <a href="#plate45">45</a>, Figs. 8,
  11, 14, is more or less common, and is often to be seen on garden walls,
  pales, and other kinds of fences. Although apparently infrequent in the
  Midlands, it has been recorded as common at Rugely in Staffordshire; in
  several parts of Cheshire it is not uncommon, and its distribution is
  known to extend to Northumberland. Possibly the species is more widely
  spread over England than the records show it to be. In Wales, it has been
  found in the North; in Scotland, it occurs locally from Berwick to
  Aberdeen; and it is doubtfully recorded from Ireland. The long, thin
  caterpillar is ochreous-brown, with a pale stripe on each side. It feeds
  on the leaves of various low plants, and seems, at times, to like its
  food best when withered. Some <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum" title="167.png"
  ><a name="page113"></a>{113}</span>that I reared from eggs deposited in
  September, 1904, fed for a time on fresh dandelion, but on the approach
  of winter they apparently ceased feeding, and were allowed to remain in
  the box with the food last supplied. In March it was found that they had
  been, and were then, eating the old provender. Some fresh dandelion was
  added, but this was not touched until all the old had been consumed. The
  same thing was repeated until the caterpillars were nearly full grown,
  when the fresh food was eaten as well as the stale. The moths resulting
  from them emerged during the last week in April, 1905, and were all well
  above the average size, and considerably larger than the female parent.
  One example is represented by Fig. 11 on the plate.</p>

  <p>There are certainly two generations of the moth during the year; in
  some years possibly more.</p>

<h5><b>Dotted Border Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>straminata</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its ordinary form this moth (Plate <a href="#plate45">45</a>, Figs.
  9, 12) is greyish white, sometimes with a tinge of brown, especially on
  the fore wings; the darker cross lines are slightly wavy; each wing has a
  central black dot, and there is a more or less distinct series of black
  dots on their outer margins. Ab. <i>circellata</i>, Guenée (Plate <a
  href="#plate61">61</a>, Fig. 3), has the first and second lines of the
  fore wings strongly defined and deep brown, and the first is united with
  the central shade above the inner margin; the corresponding lines on the
  hind wings are also deep brown. This form, which occurs on the Lancashire
  and Cheshire mosses, and is known as the Obscure Wave, has been
  considered a distinct species, but it is connected with typical
  <i>straminata</i> by intermediate aberrations which occur together with
  <i>circellata</i> and the ordinary form on the same ground. Similar
  intergrades also occur in the New Forest, Hampshire, the Dover district
  of Kent, and probably elsewhere. <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum" title="168.png"
  ><a name="page114"></a>{114}</span></p>

  <p>The rough-looking, long and slender caterpillar is pale greyish, with
  a black-edged pale line along the middle of the back, the black edging
  interrupted on rings 4-9; on each side of the central line, and lower
  down along the sides, are other black streaks; head, notched on the
  crown, and marked with brown.</p>

  <p>Some eggs laid August 8th, hatched on September 1st; the infant
  caterpillars were long and thread-like, the colour was black, and there
  was a whitish stripe low down along the sides. They would not feed on
  knotgrass and other plants offered to them, and I failed to rear them.
  Moths have, however, been bred, as a second generation, in the autumn
  from caterpillars reared from the egg, on bramble and knotgrass.</p>

  <p>The moth occurs in July and August on bush-sprinkled heaths, or heathy
  ground, where it may be disturbed from the herbage in the daytime, or
  netted as it flies in the evening. South of England from Kent to Dorset;
  also in Berkshire, Cheshire (one specimen, Whitegate Heath, 1901, one ab.
  <i>circellata</i> in Delamere Forest, July, 1903); Yorkshire (Thorne
  Moor, and rather plentiful on Skipton Common in 1900 and subsequent
  years; ab. <i>circellata</i> also occurred).</p>

<h5><b>The Dwarf Cream Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>interjectaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth (Plate <a href="#plate45">45</a>, Figs. 15, 18) is said to
  be referable to <i>fuscovenosa</i>, Goeze, and as this is an earlier name
  than <i>interjectaria</i>, Guenée, it may have to be adopted. For many
  years it was known in England as <i>osseata</i>, and was described by
  Haworth, Stephens, and others, under this name. It is also the
  <i>dilutaria</i> of some authors, but not of Hübner. Hübner's dilutaria
  is considered by some writers to be the <i>holosericata</i> of Duponchel,
  and therefore an earlier name for the species generally known by the
  latter name. <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum" title="169.png"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span></p>

  <p>The present species, to which Haworth gave the English name here used,
  is whitish straw-coloured, and silky in appearance; the wings have a
  central black dot and four or five dusky cross lines, some of which are
  more distinct than others; the front edge of the fore wings is tinged
  with reddish brown, in which is often a dark dot at the ends of the first
  and central lines; a series of linear blackish dots at the base of the
  fringes, most distinct on the fore wings.</p>

  <p>The somewhat stumpy caterpillar is dull smoky brown, marbled and
  variegated with ochreous, the darker colour most in evidence in front,
  and the ochreous behind; an ochreous line along the middle of the back,
  and one along the region of the spiracles; white spots on rings 5-7.
  (Adapted from Porritt.) It feeds from August to April on dandelion and
  other low-growing plants, and especially on the withered leaves. The moth
  occurs among weeds growing on banks, and hedgerows, and the outskirts of
  woods, in greater or lesser plenty throughout the South of England; but
  it becomes local, and more or less rare in the north of the country. In
  Scotland it is said to be uncommon in Clydesdale, but has not been noted
  from Ireland, or from Wales.</p>

<h5><b>Isle of Wight Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>humiliata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate45">45</a>, Fig. 16) is the
  <i>osseata</i> of Fabricius, but not of Haworth and other British
  authors. It is very similar in general appearance to the species last
  considered, but the wings are somewhat less ample, and rather yellower in
  tint. It is most readily recognised, however, by the distinctly reddish
  stripe on the front edge of the fore wings. Previous to 1891, when
  specimens were obtained by Mr. A. J. Hodges in the Isle of Wight, the
  species was not certainly known to be an inhabitant of the British Isles,
  although it seems to have been represented in many collections. The <!--
  Page 116 --><span class="pagenum" title="170.png"><a
  name="page116"></a>{116}</span>insect is still found by those who know
  where to look for it on the sea cliffs of its island home, but so far as
  appears to be known at present, it does not occur in any other part of
  Britain. For this reason, it does not seem desirable to indicate the
  exact locality more definitely; but it may be added that the moth flies
  in July.</p>

<h5><b>Silky Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>holosericata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Somewhat similar to A. <i>interjectaria</i>, but tinged with pale
  brown, and even more glossy; the front edge of the fore wings is of the
  general coloration, and the only markings on the wings are darker cross
  lines, the third on the fore wings, and the second on the hind wings,
  being the most distinct. (Plate <a href="#plate45">45</a>, Fig. 13.)</p>

  <p>The rough and rather stumpy caterpillar tapers towards the small
  notched head; general colour dusky reddish-brown, a pale line along the
  middle of the back, finely edged with black. It feeds from August to May
  on rock rose (<i>Helianthemum</i>), eating the withered and even mouldy
  leaves. Will eat knotgrass, and, no doubt, dandelion also.</p>

  <p>Here, again, we have an ancient name brought forward to supplant that
  which the species has borne for years, and by which it is well known to
  entomologists. As I am not quite certain that Hübner's (Fig. 100)
  <i>dilataria</i> does represent this species, Duponchel's name is here
  retained.</p>

  <p>As a British insect, it has only been known since 1851, when the
  capture of a specimen in the neighbourhood of Bristol was recorded in
  <i>The Zoologist</i>. Subsequently it transpired that the scene of
  capture was Durdham Down, Gloucestershire, and here it has been found
  annually, and in some plenty, among the bushes and low vegetation
  covering the ground in that rugged locality. Specimens have also been
  noted from Berkshire (Newbury), Bucks (Chalfont St. Peter), Dorset
  (Halstock), <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum" title="171.png"><a
  name="page117"></a>{117}</span>and Norfolk (Thetford). Possibly there are
  other localities in England, more especially in the west, where this
  species may be awaiting discovery.</p>

<h5><b>The Satin Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>subsericeata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate45">45</a>, Fig. 17)
  are glossy whitish, with a faint greyish, or sometimes yellow greyish,
  tinge; the cross lines are grey, oblique and straight on the fore wings,
  but the outer two on the hind wings are curved or bent.</p>

  <p>Var. <i>mancuniata</i>, Knaggs, a local form found in Lancashire and
  Yorkshire, is rather more tinged with yellowish, the lines being
  distinct, and some more or less distinct dusky dots on the outer margin
  of the fore wings.</p>

  <p>A blackish form, with white fringes, has been recorded from North
  Cornwall, where the species, in its usual form, has been noted as
  abundant.</p>

  <p>The rough-looking caterpillar is pale greyish, inclining to reddish
  above; three black lines along the back, the central one slender, and the
  outer ones widening out towards each end. It feeds on knotgrass,
  dandelion, chickweed, and other kinds of weeds, and will eat plum.
  Hatching in August, it hibernates, as a rule, and attains full growth in
  the following spring; but sometimes caterpillars feed up quickly, and
  produce moths the same year.</p>

  <p>The moth, which is out in June and July, is partial to heathy ground,
  but not confined to heaths, as it has been met with in lanes bordered by
  pasture fields. Widely distributed throughout England and Wales, rare in
  Scotland, where it has only been recorded from the Solway. In Ireland it
  has been found commonly at Howth, near Dublin; and in the counties Cork
  and Waterford. <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum" title="172.png"><a
  name="page118"></a>{118}</span></p>

<h5><b>Portland Ribbon Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>degeneraria</i>)</h5>

  <p>This reddish-banded species (Plate <a href="#plate46">46</a>, Fig. 1)
  is, so far as we know, only found, in Britain, in the Isle of Portland,
  Dorset, where it was first noted on June 24th, 1831. It will be seen that
  apart from its different colour, the bands in this moth are placed nearer
  the base of the wings than in <i>A. aversata</i>; on the fore wings the
  band is limited by the first and central lines, but sometimes it
  encroaches on the basal area; on the hind wings, it occupies more or less
  of the basal area, from the first line inwards; the front edge of the
  fore wings is also reddish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ridged along the sides of the roughened body, and
  tapers towards the slightly notched, blackish marked head; the general
  colour is reddish-ochreous, darker on the back of the middle rings, along
  which are three interrupted pale greyish ochreous lines, and dark
  V-shaped marks. The natural food plant is not known, but it may be reared
  from the egg on bramble, traveller's joy (<i>Clematis</i>), and, of
  course, knotgrass and dandelion, both of these plants being generally
  acceptable to larvæ of the Acidaliinæ, as well as to those of many other
  species of Geometridæ.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July in the open, but has been bred as
  early as June 2. Some of the caterpillars from eggs laid in June will
  feed up quickly, and produce moths in September; from these, other eggs
  may be obtained, the caterpillars from which will feed for a time and
  then hibernate; as also do the slow-growing individuals of the earlier
  hatching.</p>

  <p>Abroad, this seems to be a Mediterranean species, ranging eastward
  through Asia Minor to parts of Central Asia; and northwards to
  Austro-Hungary, Castile, France, and West Central Germany.</p>

<h5><b>The Plain Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>inornata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Somewhat similar to the last in appearance, but without reddish bands,
  and front edging to the fore wings; the second or outer line of the fore
  wings is generally distinct, but the others, especially the central, are
  often obscure. This species, one example of which is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate46">46</a>, Fig. 2, may be distinguished from the plain form
  of <i>A. aversata</i> by its generally smaller size and more silky
  appearance; the cross lines are less distinct, and the outer one of the
  fore wings is not indented below the front margin. The eggs (Plate <a
  href="#plate47">47</a>, Fig. 3<i>a</i>) are laid in strings of from 6-20;
  at least this is so in captivity. Like the eggs of other species in this
  genus that I have seen, they are at first whitish bone colour, changing
  to reddish. They were laid in July, and most of the caterpillars that
  hatched from them attained the moth state in September; about one-third
  hibernated, but died off during the winter.</p>

  <p>The much-wrinkled and rough-looking caterpillar is pale reddish brown,
  varying to greyish; the back with V-shaped marks, and a light coloured
  spot on rings 5 and 6. It feeds, from August to June, on dandelion, dock,
  and other weeds, also on sallow, bramble, heather, etc.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July, earlier or later in some seasons; it affects
  woods in which there is plenty of heather or bilberry, and may often be
  seen resting on tree trunks, especially those of the pine. It is on the
  wing in the evening, and is said to visit the sugar patch, as well as
  flowers growing in its haunts. Widely distributed over England and
  Scotland to Moray, but does not appear to have been noted in Wales.
  Reported from Kingstown, Killarney, and Londonderry in Ireland. <!-- Page
  120 --><span class="pagenum" title="176.png"><a
  name="page120"></a>{120}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Riband Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>aversata</i>).</h5>

  <p>There are two distinct colour forms, one is greyish white (ab.
  <i>spoliata</i>, Staudinger), and the other decidedly ochreous; the
  former is sometimes tinged with ochreous, and sometimes heavily sprinkled
  with dark grey. In the type form of <i>aversata</i>, the general colour
  is greyish white, and the space between the central and outer lines of
  the fore wings, and that enclosed by the first and central of the hind
  wings, is more or less entirely filled up with dark grey inclining to
  blackish; occasionally the dark colour spreads beyond the outer line, and
  covers a large portion of the outer area. These bands also occur in the
  ochreous and intermediate colour forms. A specimen, bred in June by Mr.
  W. G. Sheldon, from a caterpillar found on a fence at West Wickham in
  May, had the wings and abdomen black, but the head, thorax, anal tuft,
  and fringes of the wings were normal. (Plate <a href="#plate46">46</a>,
  Figs. 3-6.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate47">47</a>, Fig. 2; from
  coloured drawing by Mr. Sich) is much wrinkled, rather thickened behind,
  and tapers gradually towards the small, black-flecked head; the general
  colour is brownish, merging into ochreous on the hinder rings; a darker
  brown shade along the back, interrupted on the middle rings by V-shaped
  marks, encloses a slender whitish line, and there is a whitish spot on
  ring eight; a wavy pale ochreous line low down along the sides. (Adapted
  from Fenn.) It feeds on dandelion, dock, primrose, bedstraw, knotgrass,
  and many other low-growing plants; after hibernation, from April to May,
  it will thrive on the young growth of sallow, birch, hawthorn, etc. It
  will sometimes feed up and reach the moth state in August or
  September.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in June and July, and is generally distributed; but in
  Scotland does not seem to have been observed north of Moray. <!-- Page
  121 --><span class="pagenum" title="177.png"><a
  name="page121"></a>{121}</span></p>

<h5><b>Small Fan-footed Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>bisetata</i>).</h5>

  <p>One form (Plate <a href="#plate46">46</a>, Fig. 10) has whitish wings,
  with a deep, dark-grey border on the outer area of all the wings; this
  border is traversed by a whitish, wavy line (ab. <i>fimbriolata</i>,
  Stephens). Another form (Plate <a href="#plate46">46</a>, Fig. 7) is more
  or less typical, and in this it will be noted that the marginal borders
  are much paler, and are broken up into bandlets. Between these two forms
  there are modifications, and sometimes a greyish shade spreads over all
  the wings.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is long and slender, with a somewhat flattened
  appearance, and gradually tapered towards the notched head; the general
  colour of the roughened body is greyish brown, the middle ring divisions,
  and V-shaped marks on the back, are blackish or dark brown; there is also
  a double dark-brown line along the back, not always distinct. It feeds,
  from August to May, on a variety of low-growing plants, and is partial to
  withered leaves, especially those of bramble and dandelion. The moth is
  out in June and July, and is often common, and pretty generally
  distributed throughout our islands, except that it seems not to have been
  noted north of Moray, in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to East Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Single Dotted Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>dimidiata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The most noticeable feature in this whity brown moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate47">47</a>, Figs. 9 and 12), sometimes known as
  <i>scutulata</i>, are the larger dots at the costal end of the dotted
  cross lines, and the blackish or dark-brown chain-like mark on the lower
  part of the outer marginal area of the fore wings; the latter is
  sometimes obscured in a cloud of its own colour. <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="178.png"><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span></p>

  <p>Eggs (Plate <a href="#plate47">47</a>, Fig. 1<i>a</i>), laid in a
  batch on a dried leaf of dandelion, were whitish at first, but turned
  reddish later.</p>

  <p>The elongated and somewhat flattened caterpillar (figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate47">47</a>, Fig. 1, from a coloured drawing by Mr. Sich) is
  ochreous, with brown lines on the back, the central one double, and
  interrupted on the middle rings, upon which are oblique pale-brown
  dashes. It feeds, from September to April, on beaked parsley
  (<i>Anthriscus sylvestris</i>), burnet saxifrage (<i>Pimpinella</i>),
  etc., and may be reared on withered leaves of dandelion and other weeds.
  The moth is out in June and July, and in northern localities in August.
  Generally distributed, and often common.</p>

<h5><b>Treble Brown Spot</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Ptychopoda</i>) <i>trigeminata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate46">46</a>, Figs. 8, 11) is similar
  to the last, but generally rather larger and somewhat paler; the front
  edge of the fore wings is marked with blackish or dark purplish grey, and
  there is a band of the same colour on the outer marginal area; the inner
  edge of this band is formed by the second line, and the outer edge is
  wavy, interrupted above the middle, and sometimes below also.</p>

  <p>The rough and rather flattened caterpillar tapers towards the head; in
  colour it is dusky brown. The markings comprise interrupted black lines
  and V-shaped blackish marks on the back. Buckler states that this
  caterpillar may be distinguished from those of its nearest allies by
  having a rather long, dingy ochreous bristle from each of the raised
  dots; these bristles, which are of the same thickness throughout, curve
  forwards on all rings to the ninth, and on the other three backwards. It
  feeds, from September to April, on various low-growing plants, ivy,
  birch, etc. If kept warm, it is said that whole broods will attain the
  moth state in July or August; this may happen sometimes, but in my
  experience only a few individuals have obliged in this way. The moth is
  another inhabitant of the hedgerow and the bushy wood-border, where it
  may be disturbed in the daytime during late May and June. It flies in the
  evening, and will visit light, and occasionally the sugar patch. Always a
  local species, but not uncommon in its special haunts in Kent, Surrey,
  Wiltshire, Essex, and Suffolk; it is also found more or less frequently
  in Sussex, Hampshire, Dorsetshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and
  Worcestershire. In Scotland, it is reported as scarce in Renfrew; and
  Kane notes that it does not occur in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Lace Border</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Craspedia</i>) <i>ornata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The conspicuously marked white moth depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate46">46</a>, Figs. 13 and 14, is unlikely to escape the notice
  of the collector who visits rough fields and hillsides in some of the
  chalk districts of Southern England, especially in the counties of Kent,
  Surrey, and Sussex. Usually there are two generations of the moth during
  the year; one is on the wing in May and June, and the other flies in
  August and September.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is of long and slender build, the head is notched, and
  the skin of the body is roughened. In colour it is ochreous brown above
  and greyish beneath; there are three lines along the back, the central
  one pale, except towards the head, edged with dusky, the others dark
  brown. On each ring, from four to eight, are two dark V-shaped marks; low
  down along the sides there is a dusky edged and mottled, pale ochreous
  stripe. It feeds, from October to May, and in July and August, on thyme,
  marjoram, and may be reared on garden mint. Abroad, the species ranges
  over Central and Southern Europe, and through Asia to Amurland.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;According to Prout (<i>Entom.</i>
  xxxix. 267), this species is the type of the genus <i>Scopula</i>,
  Schrank. <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum" title="182.png"><a
  name="page124"></a>{124}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Cream Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Leptomeris</i>) <i>remutaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate49">49</a>, Figs. 1, 2) has the
  wings white or ochreous white, becoming rather smoky grey on the front
  edge of the fore wings, and sometimes this tinge spreads all over the
  wings. In well-marked specimens there are two dark, wavy, cross-lines, a
  dusky central shade, and a dusky shade-like stripe along the outer area
  beyond the second line; the first line of the fore wings is often placed
  close to the central shade, and sometimes it is merged in it. Not
  infrequently the lines are barely traceable, but almost as often the
  wings appear to have a pair of lines only, and these distinctly darker
  than usual.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is rough, long and slender; grey-brown with irregular
  darker marks, a pale line along the middle of the back, and a dark cross
  on the back of ring ten. The notched head is pale brown with a black
  V-mark. It feeds, from July to September, on bedstraw (<i>Galium</i>),
  woodruff (<i>Asperula</i>), dock, sallow, etc.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and often is plentiful in woods
  throughout the greater part of England and Wales; in Yorkshire and
  northwards through Scotland up to Moray it is rather local. In Ireland it
  has been found in Wicklow and Louth, but more commonly in the south and
  west.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Lesser Cream Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Leptomeris</i>) <i>immutata</i>).</h5>

  <p>White, more or less tinged with ochreous or ochreous grey in the male,
  is the general colour of this moth; the wings are crossed by several
  ochreous lines, the third line of the fore wings and the second line of
  the hind wings rather wavy. All the wings with central black dots, most
  distinct on the hind pair, occasionally absent from fore wings. (Plate <a
  href="#plate49">49</a>, Figs. 3 &#x2642;, 4 &#x2640;.) <!-- Page 125
  --><span class="pagenum" title="183.png"><a
  name="page125"></a>{125}</span></p>

  <p>The long caterpillar is pale greyish-brown, with three dusky lines on
  the back; the black spiracles are set in a pale stripe, and below this is
  a dusky line; head small and round (Barrett). August to May. The natural
  food appears to be <i>Valeriana officinalis</i>, and <i>Spiræa</i>, but
  it has been reared from the egg on groundsel, knotgrass, etc., also
  hawthorn, and moths obtained the same year, about September.</p>

  <p>In the open the moth is to be found in fens, bogs, and marshy places
  in fields and woods, during June and July. It is not uncommon, in
  suitable spots, in most of the southern and eastern counties of England.
  In the west, including Wales, and through the Midlands, it is local to
  Yorkshire, but is widely distributed in the south of the latter county;
  it occurs, rarely, in Durham. In Scotland it has only been definitely
  noted from Arran. Widely distributed, and common, in many parts of
  Ireland.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Mullein Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Leptomeris</i>) <i>marginepunctata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species exhibits more variation than is usual in this group.
  Typically, the moth is greyish white, but in some specimens the grey is
  most in evidence, and in others the white. A practically black form, with
  white fringes, has been noted from North Cornwall, and at Eastbourne and
  Portland many of the specimens have a clear, bone-coloured ground, with
  fine but very distinct cross-markings; these seem to be referable to ab.
  <i>pastoraria</i>, Joannis. The cross lines in both dark and light forms
  are sometimes very indistinct, but occasionally the first and second of
  the fore wings are united, and so form an irregular dusky band; the
  greyish clouding on the outer marginal area is also variable. Three <!--
  Page 126 --><span class="pagenum" title="184.png"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>specimens are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate49">49</a>; two from Eastbourne, Figs. 5 &#x2640;, 6
  &#x2642;, and one from Essex, Fig. 7 &#x2640;.</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar is very pale slaty-olive, with three paler lines
  along the back, the central one edged on each side with olive, darkest on
  the last three rings; spiracles black, and under surface of the body pale
  slate blue (adapted from Porritt). It feeds on various low-growing
  plants, among which, yarrow, mugwort, chickweed, cinquefoil, and
  knotgrass have been mentioned; also, it is said, on sallow. There are
  certainly two broods in the south, one feeding up in the summer, and the
  other hatching in September, and after hibernation attaining full growth
  in May or June. Moths of the first generation are on the wing in June and
  July, and of the second in August and September. Although sometimes found
  inland, the species is more especially attached to the coast, and is
  found in nearly all the seaboard counties of England, Wales, and Ireland.
  In Scotland, it occurs in Wigtownshire, and very dark specimens have been
  obtained on rocks in dry pastures at Ardrossan; June to end of July.</p>

<h5><b>The Lewes Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Leptomeris</i>) <i>immorata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Although the late Mr. S. Stevens exhibited a British specimen of this
  species, as a curious variety of <i>Strenia clathrata</i>, at a meeting
  of the Entomological Society of London in 1868, it was not until the year
  1887, when Mr. C. H. Morris captured two specimens in Sussex, that the
  insect became recognized as a native. It is probable that the earlier
  example, taken some years before it was shown at the meeting referred to,
  may have come from the same locality in the Lewes district where the
  later specimens were captured. Anyway, the species has, so far, not been
  recorded from any other part of our islands, but it continues to be found
  in its original haunts, described as "some heathy ground," up to the
  present day. (Plate <a href="#plate49">49</a>, Fig. 9.) <!-- Page 127
  --><span class="pagenum" title="185.png"><a
  name="page127"></a>{127}</span></p>

  <p>The long, slender, and roughened caterpillar is pale greyish brown;
  the central line along the back is greyish-white, each side edged on the
  hinder half with brown, having at the beginning of each ring after the
  third a black dot on either side; side stripes dark brown, inclining to
  black above; a slender brown line below the black spiracles. (Adapted
  from Barrett.) It feeds from August to May on ling (<i>Calluna
  vulgaris</i>), marjoram, thyme, knotgrass, etc.</p>

  <p>From eggs laid on July 1 and 2 caterpillars hatched on July 17 and 18.
  These were placed on leaves of ribwort plantain (<i>Plantago
  lanceolata</i>), and as soon as large enough transferred to a potted
  plant, and kept out of doors. Two of the caterpillars grew up quickly,
  and on August 24 were taken indoors, where they spun up for pupation, one
  on August 28, and the other on September 1. A female moth emerged
  September 14 from the first chrysalis (F. C. Woodbridge, 1906).</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to East Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Sub-angled Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Leptomeris</i>) <i>strigilaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species is greyish white, sometimes brownish-tinged; dusky cross
  markings, of which the oblique shade following the central black dot of
  the fore wings, and that before the central black dot of the hind wings,
  are usually most distinct, forming a narrow band across both pairs of
  wings; the outer margin of the hind wings is angled.</p>

  <p>The long, slender caterpillar has a roughened appearance; the colour
  is greenish grey, and the markings comprise a dull green line along the
  middle of the back, spotted with black on each side; the grey head is
  variegated with very pale brown. (Adapted from Porritt.)</p>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate49">49</a>, Fig. 8) was known to
  Haworth, who gave it the English name which it bears to-day. Stephens,
  <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum" title="186.png"><a
  name="page128"></a>{128}</span>writing of it in 1831, states that it was
  very rare, and that specimens in his collection were from a lane near
  Darenth, in Kent. With one exception (Hastings, Sussex, 1876), the only
  present known locality in the British Isles for the species is the
  Warren, near Folkestone, Kent, where it was discovered in 1859. Here it
  occurred more or less freely for several years, then it became scarce,
  and finally, about 1890, seemed to be practically extinct. In 1906,
  however, Mr. G. H. Conquest netted a female specimen in the Warren on
  July 24, and as she laid a few eggs, it may be presumed that others had
  been deposited before capture. From the eggs obtained by Mr. Conquest,
  nine moths were reared in July, 1907. The caterpillars thrived on
  traveller's joy (<i>Clematis vitalba</i>), which is probably the natural
  food; but they will also eat dandelion, knotgrass, etc., and like the
  withered leaves. By keeping in a warm place, it is possible to get moths
  out the same year, but, as a rule, the caterpillars prefer to
  hibernate.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland, China, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Rosy Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Leptomeris</i>) <i>emutaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Figure 10, Plate <a href="#plate49">49</a>, shows an example of this
  species, which also has angled hind wings. In coloration it is whiter and
  more silky than the last, and when fresh is delicately tinged with pink;
  the first and second lines are dotted or represented by dots, and the
  greyish central shade is obliquely inclined in the direction of the tips
  of the wings. In the marshes on the Essex and Kentish coasts the species
  is generally rather more rosy (ab. <i>subroseata</i>, Haworth), but this
  form occurs occasionally in the New Forest also. The long, slender
  caterpillar is whitish ochreous, inclining to pinkish; on the back of
  each ring is a broad grey shade enclosing a white spot, and a faint grey
  line on each side. Spiracles, black, with black spots below them on <!--
  Page 129 --><span class="pagenum" title="187.png"><a
  name="page129"></a>{129}</span>rings four to eight; undersurface
  bluish-grey with a central white stripe. (Adapted from Fenn.) When reared
  from the egg, the caterpillar will feed on knotgrass, chickweed,
  birdsfoot trefoil, etc. The moths sometimes appear in August or
  September, but the more usual habit of the larva is to hibernate when
  small and complete growth in the following spring.</p>

  <p>The moth, which is out in July and early August, conceals itself by
  day among the vegetation growing in its somewhat restricted haunts. These
  are chiefly the marshes on the east coast, and similar spots in Kent and
  Sussex; also the bogs of Hampshire and Dorset, but especially those
  between Lyndhurst and Brockenhurst in the former county. It is not
  readily put up during the day, but towards evening it becomes active on
  the wing, and after its flight may be found sitting about upon the
  herbage.</p>

  <p>Abroad, it seems to be pretty much confined to Southern Europe and
  North-west Africa.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Blood-vein</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Leptomeris</i>) <i>imitaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>All the wings of this pale reddish-brown species are angulated (Plate
  <a href="#plate49">49</a>, Figs. 11 and 12). A conspicuous character is
  the reddish or purplish-red stripe crossing both the wings, and to which
  its English name no doubt refers. It varies somewhat in the amount of
  reddish in the general coloration, also in the tint and the width of the
  prominent oblique cross stripe.</p>

  <p>The early stages are shown on Plate <a href="#plate48">48</a>, Figs.
  2-2<i>b</i>. The eggs, when laid on June 18 and 19, were whitish-green,
  but soon turned pinkish, inclining to coral red. The caterpillars hatched
  July 3 to 6, and were reared on a diet of privet leaves&mdash;a food that
  I have always found they preferred to any other that has been offered to
  them, and upon which I have found them in the open. They are exceedingly
  easy to rear, and if, as sometimes happens, they refuse to feed up and
  get through to the moth state in <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum" title="188.png"
  ><a name="page130"></a>{130}</span>September of the same year, they do
  not die off during the winter or early spring, as do so many larvæ of
  other hibernating species. Enclosed in a suitable receptacle, such as a
  roomy glass cylinder, with some twigs of privet plugged in a bottle of
  water, the caterpillars may be left in any odd corner until spring, when
  fresh twigs should be introduced from time to time. Other food plants are
  dock, groundsel, dandelion, knotgrass, bedstraw, etc. In colour the
  caterpillar is pale ochreous brown, with three darker brown lines on the
  back, the central one broken on the front rings, and the others edged
  above with whitish; the spiracles are black, and the stripe along the
  side pale drab.</p>

  <p>The moth affects hedgerows, banks, bushy places on rough sloping
  ground, and sandhills by the sea. It flies in the evening, and may be met
  with in July and August, sometimes in September, in most English and
  Welsh counties, and in the south of Ireland. It is local and somewhat
  rare in Northern England, and seems not to occur in Scotland.</p>

<h5><b>Tawny Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Leptomeris</i>) <i>rubiginata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This attractive little moth (Plate <a href="#plate50">50</a>, Figs. 1,
  2), known also as <i>rubricata</i> Fab., varies in colour from ochreous
  brown with a purplish or reddish tinge, to purplish brown or crimson; the
  first line of the fore wings is curved, and the second is parallel with
  the central shade. Sometimes the space between the last two lines and
  between the first and second lines of the hind wings is paler than the
  general colour. A dusky brown form has been recorded from boggy heaths in
  Norfolk.</p>

  <p>The roughish caterpillar, which gradually tapers to the notched head,
  is greyish inclining to yellowish or greenish; three blackish lines on
  the back, the central one widened on the middle rings, and the others
  only distinct on the front rings; a black-edged pale line above the black
  spiracles, and a dusky stripe below them (Barrett). It feeds from August
  to May on clover, trefoil, <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum" title="189.png"
  ><a name="page131"></a>{131}</span>knotgrass, etc. Sometimes as a second
  generation in June and July.</p>

  <p>According to Stephens, who figured this species in 1831, a specimen
  was taken, near Dover, somewhere about 1825; he also refers to Yorkshire
  specimens, one of which he had in his collection. Since that time the
  species has been obtained in Lancashire (Ashton-on-Mersey), and it was
  noted, not uncommon from the first to third week in July, 1875, on low
  heathery ground at Winch Bridge, Upper Teesdale, Durham. Casual specimens
  have also been recorded from Folkestone, Kent; Hastings, Sussex, and
  South Devon. The last concerns a specimen taken in the Newton Abbot
  district in 1902. What may be termed the British home of the species is,
  however, the Breck sand district in the eastern counties, where, since
  1860, it has been found in greater or lesser plenty, in June, each year
  up to the present time. The best known localities are Tuddenham, Brandon,
  Thetford, and Bury St. Edmunds. It sits among the vegetation in fields or
  the borders thereof, and also on heaths. Occasionally, it indulges in
  flight in the afternoon, but it is more often put up as the collector
  approaches its place of retreat. At night it is usually active, and light
  has a strong attraction for it.</p>

  <p>Abroad, its range extends to Amurland and Corea.</p>

<h5><b>The Smoky Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Pylarge</i>) <i>fumata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The sexes of this greyish-white moth are figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate50">50</a>, Figs. 4 &#x2642;, 5 &#x2640;. It will be seen
  that the female is smaller than the male. The caterpillar is very
  slender, and finely wrinkled; pale ochreous brown, with three pale lines
  along the back, each of which is shaded on both sides with brown. Beneath
  the ridge, low down along the sides, is a dark stripe, and the under
  surface is pale. It feeds on bilberry, sallow and heather, and will eat
  knotgrass, chickweed, and dandelion. Hatching in August, it <!-- Page 132
  --><span class="pagenum" title="190.png"><a
  name="page132"></a>{132}</span>hibernates when nearly mature, but it
  resumes feeding in the spring. The moth is out in June and July, and
  frequents moors and mosses. Plentiful in Scotland and in the north of
  England, its range extends through Wales and the west of England to
  Devonshire, where it occurs on Exmoor and is common in some parts of that
  extensive area. In Ireland, recorded by Birchall as widely distributed;
  Kane notes it from counties Kerry, Waterford, and Galway.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Bright Wave</b> (<i>Acidalia</i> (<i>Sterrha</i>) <i>ochrata</i>).</h5>

  <p>At one time this ochreous brown species (Plate <a
  href="#plate50">50</a>, Fig. 3) was an inhabitant of the Essex coast, and
  was found commonly at Southend among other places. Deal and other parts
  of the Kentish coast are more frequently mentioned in connection with
  later records of the species. In the present day it is far less plentiful
  at Deal than formerly, but it is still to be found there. Specimens have
  been taken in the Isle of Wight, and one has been noted from Suffolk
  (Aldeburgh).</p>

  <p>The pale ochreous brown or greyish ochreous caterpillar has three
  broken greyish lines on the back; it tapers towards the small head, and
  the skin of the body is closely wrinkled. It feeds from August to May, or
  a little later, on the flowers of hawk's-beard (<i>Crepis</i>),
  dandelion, coltsfoot, golden rod, etc., and in confinement it seems to
  accept most kinds of flowers that are offered, even when widely
  different. Thus, Mr. Conquest, in 1907, had some caterpillars which
  hatched during the first week in August from eggs laid on July 25; these
  were at first supplied with flowering sprays of yellow bedstraw
  (<i>Galium verum</i>), and later on with the flowers of golden rod
  (<i>Solidago</i>). Instead of hibernating, which is no doubt the normal
  habit in the species, some larvæ reared from the egg in confinement and
  subjected to fostering warmth will grow very quickly and produce moths
  the same year.</p>

  <p>This species has been referred to the genus <i>Sterrha</i>, Hübner,
  but authorities are not agreed as to the validity of this.</p>

<h5><i>Acidalia perochraria.</i></h5>

  <p>The species last referred to as <i>A. ochrata</i> was formerly known
  in Britain as <i>pallidaria</i>, and was figured by Curtis in 1831 under
  that name. Afterwards the name was changed to <i>perochraria</i>, and
  later still the correct name was found for it.</p>

  <p>How far there may have been confusion of the two species in the
  records of the present one, I have no means of ascertaining, but probably
  all but two should properly refer to <i>ochrata</i>. The only two known
  British specimens of <i>perochraria</i> therefore appear to have been
  captured in the Redhill district of Surrey, one in 1865 and one in 1869.
  As will be seen on reference to Plate <a href="#plate50">50</a>, where a
  portrait of a Continental specimen will be found (Fig. 6), the general
  colour is much brighter than that of <i>ochrata</i>. It will be noted,
  also, that there are four darker cross lines on the fore wings, and three
  on the hind wings. The antennæ, too, of the male are toothed, and
  therefore differ from these organs in <i>ochrata</i>.</p>

<h5><b>The Small Scallop</b> (<i>Ania emarginata</i>).</h5>

  <p>As will be noted on turning to Plate <a href="#plate50">50</a>, Figs.
  7, 8, the male of this pale ochreous brown species is generally rather
  larger than the female, and the more ample wings are less acutely angled
  in outline; the latter sex is also more clouded with reddish brown.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is variable in colour; one form is of a dusky ochreous
  colour with a pale line along the middle of the back, edged on each side
  with a darker tint, and most conspicuously <!-- Page 134 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="194.png"><a name="page134"></a>{134}</span>so on
  the hinder rings; the back is also dotted with black, and has some dark
  V- or X-shaped marks upon it; the body tapers to the notched dark-brown
  head. It feeds on bedstraw (<i>Galium</i>), convolvulus, etc., and, like
  others of its tribe, has a taste for withered leaves. August to May or
  June, according to the season. In confinement it has been induced by
  warmth to feed up quickly, and appear as a moth the same year. Only a
  short time is passed in the chrysalis stage. July is perhaps the best
  month for the moth, but it may be seen at any time from late June to
  early August. Its haunts are fens, marshes, and moist woodlands, etc.,
  and although it is more frequent in the south, it is widely spread
  throughout England, but in the north it is rare, and its occurrence more
  or less casual.</p>

  <p>In Wales it has been recorded from Glamorganshire and Flintshire; but
  it is apparently unknown in Scotland and Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Blood-vein</b> (<i>Timandra amata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The stripe across the wings of this pretty species (Plate <a
  href="#plate50">50</a>, Figs. 9 and 10), extending from the apex of the
  fore wings to near the middle of the inner margin of the hind wings, is
  normally pinkish red, but it may be of a more crimson or purplish hue; it
  also varies in width. The fringes are usually pinkish red, and
  occasionally the margins of the wings are tinged with the same colour.
  The whitish-ochreous ground colour is normally finely powdered with grey,
  but sometimes so thickly that a greyish tinge is imparted to the wings.
  Barrett mentions a specimen with pale smoky brown wings, and, excepting
  that the tips of the fringes are tinged with pink, the usual markings are
  absent. In another example, "the space between the central and second
  lines is filled up with purple brown."</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brownish grey, with three whitish lines on the
  back, the central one intersecting a series of four dark <!-- Page 135
  --><span class="pagenum" title="195.png"><a
  name="page135"></a>{135}</span>lozenges. It feeds on various low-growing
  plants, such as persicaria, orach, sorrel, etc., but dock seems to be the
  most frequently selected pabulum. July to May, sometimes feeding up and
  appearing as a second generation of the moth in August.</p>

  <p>Weedy ditches, hedge banks, or moist waste places, are the favourite
  resorts of the moth; and when one example is flushed from its lurking
  place, others are almost certain to be hiding in the immediate
  vicinity.</p>

  <p>Widely distributed throughout England, but most common in the south;
  found also in North and South Wales; and sparingly in Scotland to
  Aberdeenshire, also recorded from Arran. Apparently rare in Ireland, as
  it is only noted from Kerry and Galway.</p>

<h5><b>False Mocha</b> (<i>Ephyra porata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The wings are pale ochreous brown, finely flecked with purplish grey,
  and more or less tinged with reddish; the cross lines are indicated by
  blackish dots, the central shade is greyish inclining to reddish, and the
  rings enclosing white dots are blackish or dark brown, but sometimes
  indistinct on the fore wings; occasionally there are some purplish grey
  clouds on the outer marginal area, and this is more frequent in examples
  of a second generation. Sometimes the wings are entirely suffused with
  dull reddish brown, and all the markings, except the white dot on the
  hind wings, are obscured. (Plate <a href="#plate53">53</a>, Figs. 7 and
  8.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale pinkish ochreous, with inconspicuous wavy
  white lines, and brownish dots, on the back; dark oblique marks on the
  sides; the head is pencilled with darker brown. It feeds on oak and birch
  in June and July, and individuals of a second brood sometimes occur in
  September or October.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and rests in the daytime <!-- Page
  136 --><span class="pagenum" title="196.png"><a
  name="page136"></a>{136}</span>among the foliage of trees and bushes in
  or around woods. Like others of the genus, it is attracted by light, and
  is said to visit the sugar patch. Specimens of a second generation
  sometimes appear in August and September, but, I believe, more frequently
  in the breeding cage than in the open. Although it has been recorded from
  several of the northern counties from Staffordshire to Cumberland, this
  is more especially an inhabitant of the south and west of England, and of
  Wales. In Scotland, it is known to occur singly and rarely in Clydesdale
  and Arran, and has been found in Perthshire.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;This species, and the other five
  here included in <i>Ephyra</i>, have been referred to <i>Zonosoma</i>,
  Lederer, and more recently to <i>Cyclophora</i>, Stephens.</p>

<h5><b>Maiden's Blush</b> (<i>Ephyra punctaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>In a general way, this moth (Plate <a href="#plate53">53</a>, Figs.
  10-12) is not unlike the last mentioned. Apart, however, from the absence
  of ringed dots on all the wings, the central line is more prominent.
  Certain vagaries occur in connection with this line, which is generally
  reddish, or purplish brown. Occasionally, it may be visible on the fore
  wings, but absent on the hind wings; or it may change its course about
  mid-way, and turn inwards to the base of the fore wing. I have a specimen
  from Surrey in which this line is double the normal width, and dark
  purplish in colour. Examples of the second generation have brownish
  clouds on the outer margin (Fig. 12).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale reddish-ochreous or bright green; a black line
  along the middle of the back, and a brownish one along the sides; a black
  horse-shoe mark, edged below with yellow, on the back of rings four to
  nine.</p>

  <p>It feeds, in June and July, on oak, but may be reared on birch; also
  found in September as a second brood. <!-- Page 137 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="197.png"><a name="page137"></a>{137}</span></p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and specimens of a second generation
  are often not uncommon in August. It occurs in woodlands throughout
  England, but is most plentiful in the south. In Scotland, it appears to
  be local in Clydesdale, but is found thence up to Moray. In Ireland, only
  recorded from Galway (two specimens).</p>

<h5><b>Clay Triple-Lines</b> (<i>Ephyra linearia</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate53">53</a>, Fig. 13) varies in the
  general colour from yellowish to pale reddish ochreous; the cross lines
  are also variable, often the first is missing (Plate <a
  href="#plate53">53</a>, Fig. 14), and not infrequently the dark central
  line is the only visible marking, but very exceptionally the central line
  is very little, if at all, more distinct than the normal first and
  second. The ringed white dots are rarely very conspicuous, and are often
  quite absent.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale brownish, with a brown-edged yellowish line
  along the middle of the back, and some yellow-edged dark-brown streaks on
  the sides. In another form, the head is brown and the body green.</p>

  <p>It feeds in June, July, and again in September, on beech. The moth is
  out in May and June, and again in August and September. Beech woods are
  its favourite haunts, and it seldom strays far from them. It is generally
  common in the south, and its range apparently extends to Northumberland;
  but it is local and infrequent in the north. Three specimens have been
  recorded from Co. Galway, and one from Co. Cork, in Ireland.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;Nearly fifty years ago, at
  Brighton, a single specimen was reared from one of eight larvæ that
  hatched from the same number of eggs deposited by a female <i>E.
  linearia</i> that had paired with a male <i>E. orbicularia</i>. This
  hybrid has been named <i>brightoni</i>, Tutt. <!-- Page 138 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="198.png"><a name="page138"></a>{138}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Mocha</b> (<i>Ephyra annulata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Normally, the wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate53">53</a>,
  Figs. 6, 9) are yellowish white, inclining to ochreous yellow with the
  blackish central shade near to and sometimes united with the blackish
  irregular and outwardly toothed second cross line on both fore and hind
  wings; the rings are deep brown or blackish. There is variation in the
  width and intensity of the central shade, and the rings sometimes are
  absent on the fore wings (ab. <i>obsoleta</i>, Riding), and occasionally
  all the wings are devoid of the annular mark (ab. <i>biobsoleta</i>,
  Riding). Examples of a second generation reared in captivity are rather
  deeper coloured, and have a sprinkling of black scales, chiefly on the
  fore wings.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate51">51</a>, Fig. 2, after
  Hofmann) is dark green, yellow between the rings; there are three yellow
  lines along the back, the outer ones waved; head reddish brown, paler
  marked. (Adapted from Porritt.) There is also a pale ochreous brown
  form.</p>

  <p>It feeds on maple in June, and as a second generation in August and
  September. It may be reared on sycamore. The moth frequents lanes, woods,
  and thickets, especially those in which maple is plentiful; it flies at
  dusk, and in the daytime may be beaten from hedgerows in which the food
  plant grows. It has also been found among hornbeam. The species is most
  frequent from Kent to Hampshire, but widely distributed over England up
  to Worcester and Herefordshire, and eastward to Norfolk, occurring also
  in Northampton and Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>The colour and ornamentation of this charming little insect seem to
  have struck Haworth, who named the species in the vernacular, as bearing
  some resemblance to the Mocha stone from Arabia, a kind of transparent
  agate in which are seen brownish moss-like markings. <!-- Page 139
  --><span class="pagenum" title="199.png"><a
  name="page139"></a>{139}</span></p>

<h5><b>Dingy Mocha</b> (<i>Ephyra orbicularia</i>).</h5>

  <p>The wings are greyish, thickly striped with darker grey; the markings
  similar to those of the next species, but the rings are nearly always
  reddish or purplish, and the central line is wavy. (Plate <a
  href="#plate53">53</a>, Figs. 4 and 5.)</p>

  <p>The egg (which, together with the caterpillar and chrysalis, is
  figured on Plate <a href="#plate51">51</a>) is at first bone-coloured;
  later, pink dots and patches appear.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is bright green with three lines along the back, the
  central one edged on each side with dark green and the others wavy; the
  sides are blotched with pink or pale purple, or sometimes whitish and
  unmarked; head slightly notched on the crown, pale brown, marked with
  darker; fore legs tipped with pink. (Porritt, abridged.) In another form
  of the green coloration, the sides are pinkish with dark-brown oblique
  stripes; in a third the general colour is pale brown. The first brood of
  caterpillars feeds in June on sallow and alder, and a second in August
  and September.</p>

  <p>The moth appears in May and June, and again in July and August;
  sometimes a third brood has been reared in captivity. It is less
  frequently met with than the other species of <i>Ephyra</i>, even in its
  most favourite haunts, such as the New Forest, in Hampshire. Other
  localities for it are Abbots Wood, St. Leonards and Tilgate Forests, and
  elsewhere in Sussex; Redstone, Haslemere, and the Croydon districts, in
  Surrey; and in some Kentish woods. It has also been taken rarely in
  Dorset, Devon (Tiverton), S. Wales, and Suffolk (Lowestoft).</p>

<h5><b>Birch Mocha</b> (<i>Ephyra pendularia</i>).</h5>

  <p>The general colour of this species (Plate <a href="#plate53">53</a>,
  Figs. 1, 2) is whitish, more or less powdered or suffused with grey; all
  the <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum" title="200.png"><a
  name="page140"></a>{140}</span>wings have two blackish dotted cross lines
  and a greyish, sometimes reddish, central shade; not infrequently there
  is an interrupted grey or dark greyish band on the outer marginal area,
  and this margin itself is always dotted with black; the rings enclosing
  white dots on all the wings are usually black, but sometimes reddish. In
  some specimens having a reddish central shade, the general colour,
  especially of the fore wings, is delicately tinged with reddish. Var.
  <i>subroseata</i>, Woodforde (Fig. 3), a form of this species occurring
  in N. Staffs. is slaty grey, with the space between the inner and outer
  cross lines of fore wings rosy pink or reddish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is of a green colour with slender yellowish lines
  along the back and sides; between the rings the colour inclines to
  yellowish, and the head, legs, and prolegs are reddish brown. In another
  form the general colour is greyish, inclining to reddish, and the lines
  paler grey. It feeds on birch in June and July, and again in August and
  September. It is said to eat alder and oak. The chrysalis, which is
  similar in shape to that of the last species (Plate <a
  href="#plate51">51</a>), is pale greyish-ochreous marked with dark
  brown.</p>

  <p>The moth, which appears in May and June, and in some seasons in
  August, frequents woodlands and heaths where birch flourishes. Although
  fairly plentiful in most of the southern English counties, it appears to
  be rare in Dorset and Devon, and more or less so in the eastern counties.
  It is very local in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire, but not uncommon at
  Strensall in the latter county; and although it has been recorded from
  Cumberland, it seems to be absent from Lancashire and Cheshire.
  Doubtfully reported from North Northumberland, but found in Wells Wood,
  Roxburghshire, and appears to be widely distributed in Scotland, although
  generally scarce in that country. In Ireland it is local, but not
  uncommon sometimes.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Eastern Siberia.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">HYDRIOMENINÆ.</h5>

<h5><b>The Vestal</b> (<i>Sterrha sacraria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are pale yellow inclining to ochreous, and the front
  edge is more or less tinged with the same colour as that of the oblique
  stripe from the tips of the wings to the middle of the inner margin. In
  the type, this stripe is purplish-brown, but in ab. <i>labda</i>, Cramer,
  it is crimson, and in ab. <i>atrifasciaria</i>, Stefan, it is blackish.
  In ab. <i>sanguinaria</i>, Esper, the ground colour is pinkish. The hind
  wings are always white. (Plate <a href="#plate54">54</a>, Figs. 1 and
  2.)</p>

  <p>From 1857, in which year the first specimen recorded as British was
  captured in September at Plymouth, to 1874, one or more examples of this
  interesting migrant seem to have occurred during the autumns of most
  years, in some part of the British Isles, but chiefly in the South of
  England. The years in which it was apparently unrecorded were 1860, 1861,
  1870, 1872, and 1873. Since 1874 there have been very few records. In
  1879 a male specimen was taken at Chingford, Essex, August 17th, and a
  female (ova obtained) on September 1st; a specimen occurred at
  Christchurch, Hants, October, 1893; a male was obtained in the Isle of
  Purbeck, Dorset, September, 1895, and one was secured at Timoleague, Co.
  Cork, in August, 1898; one was accounted for at Malvern, Worcestershire,
  in August, 1901; a female in fine condition was captured, as it flew in
  the sunshine over a Cambridgeshire meadow, in the autumn of 1906. Mr. H.
  M. Edelsten obtained a male specimen in South Devon, on September 12,
  1908. The largest number of specimens appears to have been recorded in
  1867, when nearly thirty were secured, and of these four were taken in
  May in the Isle of Wight, where also two females were captured on <!--
  Page 142 --><span class="pagenum" title="204.png"><a
  name="page142"></a>{142}</span>August 14th and 16th, and one specimen on
  September 3rd. Six or seven occurred during August in Lancashire, and
  three in Perthshire, also in August.</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar is variable, but is usually some shade of green
  above, inclining to whitish beneath, and yellowish between the rings; the
  lines along the back are paler green, reddish, and olive green. It feeds
  on low-growing plants, such as knotgrass and dock, and has been reared
  from the egg in August and September. If eggs were obtained in May it
  would be possible to raise two generations of moths, or, perhaps, even
  three, during the year.</p>

  <p>The species is an inhabitant of Southern Europe and North Africa, and
  its range extends to India, Madeira, and the Canaries. In Central Europe,
  including the British Isles, its occurrence is always a more or less
  casual event.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;It is possibly incorrect to assign
  this species to <i>Sterrha</i>, Hübner, which is adopted by some authors
  for the Acidaliid <i>ochraria</i>. There is, however, considerable doubt
  among authorities about accepting the Hübnerian genus, but
  Herrich-Schäffer's genus <i>Sterrha</i> appears to be valid and is here
  employed. If it has to give way, <i>Pseudosterrha</i>, Warren, or
  <i>Rhodometra</i>, Meyrick, may have to be used.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Lythria purpuraria</i> has long been reported as a British species,
  but there does not appear to be any very convincing record of its capture
  in the British Isles. It is widely distributed in Europe, and generally
  common. As it is a sun-loving insect, it could hardly escape detection if
  it occurred in any part of our isles. A note by Mr. V. R. Perkins, in
  <i>The Zoologist</i> for 1861, p. 7449, should, however, not be
  overlooked. This refers to the capture, on June 18th, of two male
  specimens that were disturbed from broom, "not far from the city of
  Perth, by Mr. D. P. Morrison." <!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum" title="205.png"
  ><a name="page143"></a>{143}</span></p>

<h5><b>Lead Belle</b> (<i>Ortholitha plumbaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two ordinary examples of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate54">54</a>, Figs. 4, 5. The ground colour is greyish, ranging
  in one direction to whitish, and in the other to brownish; on the fore
  wings there are three cross lines, usually reddish-brown in colour, but
  sometimes dark brown inclining to blackish; the first of these lines is
  always slender and sometimes very indistinct; the second is often shaded
  on its outer edge, and the third on its inner edge, with brownish;
  occasionally the space between the second and third is more or less
  dusky, especially on the lower half; sometimes these two lines approach
  each other very closely on the inner margin; the short oblique streak
  from the tip of the wing to the wavy submarginal line, and also the
  blackish central dot, are far more distinct in some specimens than in
  others.</p>

  <p>The long stick-like caterpillar is pale ochreous brown, often striped
  with darker brown or blackish. It feeds on furze (<i>Ulex</i>) and broom
  (<i>Cytisus</i>), from August to April. The moth is out in May and June,
  earlier or later according to the season, and is to be found almost
  everywhere that its food plants flourish.</p>

<h5><b>The Mallow</b> (<i>Ortholitha cervinata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species are normally ochreous brown, inclining
  to reddish, but sometimes the general colour is of a light chocolate
  tint, and in such specimens the slender white lines edging the dark
  markings, and the white wavy submarginal line, are more distinct; the
  central band-like marking occasionally tapers towards the inner margin.
  (Plate <a href="#plate54">54</a>, Figs. 6, 7.)</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar (figured from a coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich,
  Plate <a href="#plate52">52</a>, Fig. 1) is of a greenish colour,
  inclining <!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum" title="206.png"><a
  name="page144"></a>{144}</span>to yellowish between the rings; there are
  indications of darker lines on the middle of the back and along the
  sides; the usual dots are whitish and the spiracles black; in some
  specimens the central line on the back is pinkish. It hatches from the
  egg in March or April, and feeds until June on mallow (<i>Malva
  sylvestris</i>); will also eat hollyhock.</p>

  <p>The moth appears in September and October, and is sometimes seen in
  November. It hides under the mallow, and other plants around, and is not
  much inclined to move during the day, but it becomes active in the
  evening, and then flies pretty briskly. The occurrence of this species in
  any locality will, of course, largely depend upon the presence of the
  food plant, but it seems to be widely distributed throughout the greater
  part of the British Isles. It is, however, most frequent in the southern
  half of England.</p>

<h5><b>Shaded Broad-bar</b> (<i>Ortholitha limitata</i>).</h5>

  <p>To the earliest British entomologists this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate54">54</a>, Figs. 8 and 9) was known by the English name
  given to it by Moses Harris, which is here revived. Haworth's popular
  name for the insect is the "Small Mallow," but this seems less
  suitable.</p>

  <p>The fore wings are usually ochreous brown in colour, with a darker
  brown band, the inner area of which is often paler. The ground colour,
  however, varies considerably, in some examples tending to whity brown,
  and in others to a smoky hue. The whitish hind wings are generally more
  or less dusky clouded, chiefly from the base of the wing to the dark
  brown or blackish cross shade; but sometimes these wings are entirely
  blackish, with just a trace of a pale cross stripe.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greyish, with a pinkish tinge and black dots; there
  are three lines along the back, the central one slaty blue, and the
  others ochreous, shaded on each side with pale brown; a pinkish irregular
  ridge runs low down along the sides. It feeds on clover, vetch, grass,
  etc., from September to June. (Plate <a href="#plate52">52</a>, Fig. 2,
  after Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, and is often common in fields and
  grassy places, generally throughout the greater part of the British
  Isles. In ancient times it was dubbed the "Aurelian's Plague." The range
  abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><i>Ortholitha moeniata.</i>&mdash;Except that one specimen was said to
  have been taken near Baron Wood, Carlisle, some years prior to 1855; and
  another, in 1866, near York; there is no evidence that this species is an
  inhabitant of the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>Chalk Carpet</b> (<i>Ortholitha bipunctaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>In this species (Plate <a href="#plate54">54</a>, Figs. 11 and 12) the
  ground colour of the fore wings is white (inclining to bluish-white in
  some specimens), more or less stippled and scored with greyish brown; the
  cross band is darker grey brown, and there are two black dots placed
  :-wise (sometimes united) in the paler central space of the band. Hind
  wings, smoky grey, with a darker shade across the middle, and a pale one
  parallel with the outer margin. In some rare instances, the ground colour
  of the fore wings is entirely white, and the band exceedingly dark; but
  specimens with the general colour, slaty-black and the band and basal
  patch grey, are extremely rare; Barrett mentions one such example, from
  Box Hill, Surrey, in Mr. R. Adkin's collection.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is whity brown, more or less tinged with pink, dotted
  with black, and lined with grey along the back, the sides, and the under
  surface. It feeds, at night, on clover and trefoils, from September to
  June. (Plate <a href="#plate52">52</a>, Fig. 3, after Hofmann.) The moth
  is out in July and August, and in suitable localities, such as chalk
  downs, lime-stone hills, etc., is generally plentiful <!-- Page 146
  --><span class="pagenum" title="210.png"><a
  name="page146"></a>{146}</span>throughout England and South Wales. It
  does not appear to have been noted in Ireland, or in Scotland, except
  that it has been recorded from the Isle of Arran.</p>

<h5><b>Oblique Striped</b> (<i>Mesotype virgata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The sexes of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate54">54</a>, Figs. 3 &#x2642;, 10 &#x2640;. The fore wings are
  greyish, inclining to whitish or to brownish, with two white-edged
  oblique bands, which in the lighter coloured specimens are broad and show
  up conspicuously, but in the darker are narrower and much less
  distinct.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brownish, but varies in tint, in some cases
  inclining to pink; there are three lines along the back, the central one
  dark green or brown, and the others more or less yellowish; a blackish or
  dark grey line low down along the sides. It feeds on yellow bedstraw
  (<i>Galium verum</i>), and may be reared on other kinds of <i>Galium.</i>
  There are two broods, one in May and June, and the other in August and
  September.</p>

  <p>The moth, which frequents sand-hills and shelving banks by the
  seaside, is found resting upon its food plant or other vegetation around,
  in May and June, and again in July and August.</p>

  <p>The species has a wide distribution, and occurs in suitable localities
  around the coasts of England (except the north-east), and on the west
  coast of Wales. It also inhabits the Breck sand district of Norfolk and
  Suffolk, and has been found on chalk downs and hills in the south of
  England, and in Cambridgeshire and Berkshire. In Ireland, it has been
  recorded from the counties of Down and Kerry.</p>

  <p>Abroad, its distribution spreads to Eastern Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Drab Looper</b> (<i>Minoa murinata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The grey brown or ochreous brown wings of this delicate, but
  unattractive little moth (Plate <a href="#plate55">55</a>, Figs. 1 and
  2), are silky in <!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum" title="211.png"
  ><a name="page147"></a>{147}</span>texture. After it has flown for a
  time, the wings become paler, and lose most of their sheen.</p>

  <p>The thick-set, roughish caterpillar is reddish brown, dotted with pale
  ochreous; there is a slender white line along the middle of the back, and
  black oblique streaks on the sides; a blackish wavy line along the area
  of the spiracles is bordered below with yellowish. It feeds on wood
  spurge (<i>Euphorbia amygdaloides</i>) and also, I have reason to
  believe, on petty spurge (<i>E. peplus</i>), a rather common weed in some
  gardens, from July to September. In forward seasons the moth, which flies
  in the sunshine, has been noted in late April, but May and June are the
  best months for it. In the New Forest, and elsewhere, it has occurred in
  August. On one occasion I remember that, in a garden at Brockenhurst,
  several specimens were taken in the autumn, and it was supposed that they
  resulted from eggs laid by a damaged female that had been captured in the
  woods and turned out into said garden. It has been taken at gas lamps, at
  Dorking among other places.</p>

  <p>The species has been recorded from Pembrokeshire, Glamorganshire, and
  Monmouth, in South Wales; and it appears to be found in most of the
  counties of England southwards from Worcester, Hereford, Gloucester,
  Oxford, and Bucks. Except that it has been doubtfully recorded from
  Stowmarket, Suffolk, it does not seem to be found in the eastern
  counties; and I cannot find that it has been noted from Devon or
  Cornwall.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Chimney-sweeper</b> (<i>Odezia atrata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This white-tipped but otherwise plain black moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate55">55</a>, Figs. 4 &#x2642;, 5 &#x2640;) is very constant,
  and except that specimens after having been on the wing for a day or two
  become sooty brown, there is nothing much to note. It is the fringe at
  the tip of the <!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum" title="212.png"><a
  name="page148"></a>{148}</span>fore wings rather than the tip itself that
  is white, and this sometimes extends for a short distance along the
  fringe of the outer margin. Haworth's English name for this insect (his
  <i>chærophyllata</i>) was "The Looping Chimney Sweeper" in reference to
  its caterpillar, and to distinguish it from his "Chimney Sweeper,"
  "Chimney Sweeper's Boy," and other oddities in the vernacular among the
  Psychids.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds in the spring on flowers of the earth-nut
  (<i>Conopodium denudatum</i>, or <i>Bunium flexuosum</i>), is green, and
  paler on the sides than on the back; there are three darker green lines
  along the back, the central one merging into reddish on the last ring,
  and the others narrowly edged on each side with white; a whitish stripe
  runs below the red spiracles.</p>

  <p>The moth is a sun lover, and flits about flowers growing among or near
  its food plant, in June and July.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed over England, Wales, Ireland, and
  Scotland, but it does not appear to have been noted north of Moray in the
  last-named country. It is always very local, frequents moist fields,
  borders of woods, and even waysides.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Grey Carpet</b> (<i>Lithostege griseata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The more or less greyish moth, shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate55">55</a>, Fig. 3, varies in tint, some specimens being
  decidedly more grey than others. At the apex of the fore wings is a short
  blackish dash, and from this a curved dusky line may be traced to the
  inner margin. The female has the wings rather shorter than those of the
  male.</p>

  <p>The slender, dark-lined, greenish caterpillar feeds on the seed pods
  of flixweed (<i>Sisymbrium</i>), and treacle mustard (<i>Erysimum</i>),
  in July and August. When reared in captivity it will thrive on other
  kinds of Cruciferæ. <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum" title="213.png"
  ><a name="page149"></a>{149}</span></p>

  <p>The moth is out in June, sometimes late May; it is exceedingly local
  in Britain, and only occurs in the Breck district, where it was first met
  with about fifty years ago. Tuddenham, in Suffolk, is a noted locality,
  as also is Thetford, in Norfolk.</p>

<h5><b>The Treble-bar</b> (<i>Anaitis plagiata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is a greyish white species, of which specimens of both
  generations are shown on Plate <a href="#plate55">55</a>, Figs. 6
  &#x2642;, 7 &#x2640; (1st generation), Fig. 8 &#x2642; (2nd generation).
  The chief variation is in the cross central bars of the fore wings, which
  are sometimes much widened, and occasionally joined from the middle to
  the inner margin; or the space between these two bars is more or less
  filled up with dark grey. On the other hand, the bars are sometimes very
  faint, but such aberrations are perhaps most frequent in the second
  generation, which consists of smaller specimens.</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar is brown, inclining to reddish or to greenish,
  with several darker and paler lines on the back and a yellowish line low
  down along the sides. It feeds on St. John's wort (<i>Hypericum</i>) in
  June and July; the caterpillars, hatching in the autumn, are not mature
  until the following April.</p>

  <p>Usually there are two generations of the moth, the first appearing in
  May and June, and the second in August and September. The species is
  pretty generally distributed over the British Isles, extending to the
  Hebrides and the Orkneys; and will probably be found in all localities
  where its food plant occurs freely. It affects cliffs and sandhills by
  the sea, rough places on chalk slopes, and sometimes the moths fly up in
  numbers as we walk over the herbage in such spots.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Western India and Japan. <!-- Page 150
  --><span class="pagenum" title="214.png"><a
  name="page150"></a>{150}</span></p>

<h5><b>Manchester Treble-bar</b> (<i>Carsia paludata</i>).</h5>

  <p>In general character this species somewhat resembles that last
  considered. It is, however, much smaller, and there are reddish clouds on
  the outer marginal area.</p>

  <p>This reddish shading is more or less absent in the type, which is
  otherwise less variegated than var. <i>imbutata</i>, the form to which
  our British specimens are almost entirely referable. (Plate <a
  href="#plate55">55</a>, Figs. 9 and 10.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is of somewhat stoutish build, and reddish brown in
  colour; three darker lines along the back, and yellow stripe low down
  along the sides, the latter edged above with black on the front three
  rings, and blotched with pinkish on the middle rings; the head is rather
  paler than the body, and the dots on the latter are yellow. It feeds on
  cowberry (<i>Vaccinium vitis-idæa</i>) and cranberry (<i>V.
  oxycoccos</i>), and seems to have a preference for the flowers of these
  plants: April to June.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August among the <i>Vaccinium</i> in its
  swampy haunts on the heaths and moors of the north of England, and
  Scotland, even to the Shetlands. McArthur took a specimen in the Isle of
  Lewis in 1901. It also occurs in Ireland. In England it does not seem to
  have been noted south of Staffordshire.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Eastern Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Streak</b> (<i>Chesias spartiata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The most striking features of this shining brownish coloured species
  are the oval-shaped marks on the disk of the fore wings, and the long
  whitish streak running to the tips of the wings. (Plate <a
  href="#plate57">57</a>, Figs. 3 &#x2642;, 4 &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate56">56</a>, Fig. 2) is deep
  green, with a darker line along the middle of the back, and whitish lines
  along the sides and the under surface; the spiracles are reddish,
  encircled with black, and the head is flecked with brown. It feeds in the
  spring on broom (<i>Cytisus scoparius</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth is out in September and October, and secretes itself during
  the day, but may be found at night flying about the broom bushes for a
  short time, and later on it sits upon the twigs. It occurs in almost
  every part of the British Isles where the food plant of the caterpillar
  is well established.</p>

<h5><b>Broom-tip</b> (<i>Chesias rufata</i>).</h5>

  <p>A noticeable character in this glossy, greyish moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate57">57</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;) is the black mark
  on the upper part of the second cross line of the fore wings (which
  probably suggested the English name "Chevron" given to the species by
  Donovan); following the mark is a reddish or ochreous flush, extending to
  the tips of the wings.</p>

  <p>The long, green caterpillar inclines to bluish above, and to paler
  green beneath; a darker line along the middle of the back, then a slender
  whitish line edged with darker green, and between this and the white
  spiracular line there is another slender whitish line. It feeds, in
  August and September, on broom; when full grown it enters the earth, and
  there turns to a reddish brown chrysalis, the wing cases of which are
  greenish. I am indebted to Mr. A. J. Scollick for the caterpillar and
  chrysalis figured on Plate <a href="#plate56">56</a>, Figs. 1,
  1<i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>The moth emerges the following year, from May to July, but its time of
  appearance is uncertain, and it may come up in early spring or not until
  early autumn. Sometimes it will remain in the chrysalis for two
  winters.</p>

  <p>In England the species occurs in the counties of Kent, Surrey, Sussex,
  Berks, Hants, Devon, Somerset, Hereford, Worcester, Stafford, Leicester,
  Cheshire (rare in the last five), Cumberland and Yorkshire (recorded once
  from each county), <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum" title="218.png"
  ><a name="page152"></a>{152}</span>Norfolk, Suffolk; also Glamorgan, and
  other parts of South Wales. In Scotland it is found in the south, but is
  more frequent from Perthshire to Moray. Probably occurs in other British
  localities where there is plenty of broom.</p>

<h5><b>The Barred Tooth-striped</b> (<i>Lobophora</i> (<i>Trichopteryx</i>) <i>polycommata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The general colour of the species represented on Plate <a
  href="#plate57">57</a>, Figs. 5 &#x2642;, 6 &#x2640;, is greyish,
  inclining to ochreous or to whitish; but occasionally it is clouded with
  dark greyish on the basal area, and there is a broad band of the same
  colour on the outer marginal area; in such specimens the central band
  becomes less conspicuous.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate59">59</a>, Fig. 2) feeds in May
  and June, on privet, at first on the leaf buds, and afterwards on the
  expanded leaves. It will also eat ash and honeysuckle. In colour it is
  rather deep green, with three fine lines along the back, the central one
  darker than the ground colour, and the others whitish and irregular; a
  whitish stripe low down along the sides; two points on the last ring of
  the body. The chrysalis (Plate <a href="#plate59">59</a>, Fig.
  2<i>a</i>), which is enclosed in an oval earthen cocoon, is dark
  yellowish brown, inclining to blackish on the wing cases.</p>

  <p>The moth may be found at night, in March and April, sitting on the
  privet hedge, and may then be easily boxed, as it seems very disinclined
  to fly at that time, but earlier in the evening it flits along the
  hedgerows, and is equally easy to net. When resting, however, one is able
  to select just the finest specimens.</p>

  <p>The species appears to be very local in Britain, but it occurs in the
  Brighton, Lewes, and Emsworth districts of Sussex; Hants, Wilts
  (Salisbury), Somerset, Devon (Sidmouth), Gloucestershire, Herefordshire,
  Worcestershire (Malvern), <!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum" title="219.png"
  ><a name="page153"></a>{153}</span>North Lancashire, Cumberland,
  Northampton, Berks, Essex, and Kent. In Scotland it has been reported
  from Clydesdale and Arran, but has not been noted from Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Early Tooth-striped</b> (<i>Lobophora</i> (<i>Trichopteryx</i>) <i>carpinata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The whitish fore wings of this species are tinged with grey or
  greenish grey, the cross lines and bands vary in intensity, and, as a
  rule, are more distinct and complete in the female than in the male. A
  form of not infrequent occurrence in Scotland (ab. <i>fasciata</i>,
  Prout) has blackish bands, which show up in strong contrast with the
  general whitish colour of the wings. The ordinary form is represented on
  Plate <a href="#plate57">57</a>, Fig. 7 &#x2642;, and Fig. 8 on the same
  plate shows the named variety referred to.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with rather darker lines along the back, and
  a yellow stripe low down along the sides; the two points on the last ring
  are also yellow. It feeds, in June and July, on honeysuckle, sallow,
  birch, and alder. The moth is out in April and May, and seems to be more
  or less common in woodlands throughout the greater part of the British
  Isles. In Scotland it appears to be most plentiful from Perthshire
  northwards to Sutherlandshire, but it has not been reported from the
  Orkneys, Shetlands, or Hebrides. (Early stages are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate59">59</a>, Figs. 3-3<i>b</i>.)</p>

  <p>The boles of trees are favourite resting places, and upon them, and
  also upon gate-posts, etc., the moth is often met with in the
  daytime.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Eastern Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>Yellow-barred Brindle</b> (<i>Lobophora</i> (<i>Trichopteryx</i>) <i>viretata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The general colour of the fore wings is olive green, varying from pale
  to dark, the wavy cross lines are blackish, dotted <!-- Page 154 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="220.png"><a name="page154"></a>{154}</span>with
  black, and sometimes there are whitish lines between them; those on the
  central area are often united by a blackish cloud, and so form a band,
  and not infrequently the basal area is also blackish marked. (Plate <a
  href="#plate58">58</a>, Figs. 3 and 4.) The ground colour is very apt to
  fade if the insect is exposed to moisture of any kind, as, for instance,
  when pinned in a damp collecting box, but I have one bred specimen of a
  reddish ochreous colour, and I am assured that it was of this tint when
  it emerged from the chrysalis. An old English name was "The
  Brindle-barred Yellow."</p>

  <p>The thick-set caterpillar is green, more or less tinged with pinkish;
  three interrupted pink lines on the back, the central one sometimes
  inclining to purple, and broken up into spots; the head is brown,
  sometimes marked with purplish, and there are two tiny points on the last
  ring of the body. It varies in the green tint and also in marking. It
  feeds on flowers and leaves of holly, ivy, dogwood, privet, etc., in June
  and July, and in some sheltered southern localities again in September
  and October.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and early June, and where a second generation
  is developed, in August and early September. It sits in the daytime on
  tree-trunks, but more especially those with smooth bark; the stems of
  holly are a favourite resting place, but at Box Hill I have occasionally
  seen a specimen on the trunk of a beech tree. Barrett states that it also
  rests on the trunks of fir trees, and that it is then very easily seen.
  Night is its time of activity, and it is then attracted by light.</p>

  <p>The species seems to be widely distributed, but locally and not
  generally common, throughout England, Wales, and Ireland; it has only
  been recorded from Rosemount, Ayr, and one or two other localities in the
  south of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Western India, Amurland, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Seraphim</b> (<i>Lobophora halterata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fore wings whitish, with two greyish bands on the basal area; first
  and second lines greyish, variable in width, and sometimes only
  represented by marks on the front or inner margins; there is a black
  central dot, and the outer area beyond the submarginal line is clouded
  with dark grey, especially on the upper half. Sometimes the wings are so
  thickly stippled with the darker colour that they appear to be greyish,
  with interrupted and indistinct whitish cross lines. A rather frequent
  form has the fore wings tinged with ochreous, and of this tint is ab.
  <i>zonata</i>, Thnbg., which has the basal bands and outer marginal
  border blackish, the central area being without cross lines. (Plate <a
  href="#plate57">57</a>, Figs. 9 &#x2642; and 10 &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, darker below and between the rings; the most
  distinct markings are two yellow lines along the back; head, notched;
  body wrinkled, and with two points on the last ring. It feeds on aspen,
  and other kinds of poplar, in June and July.</p>

  <p>The moth appears in May, and continues out well into June, especially
  in its northern localities. It rests on the trunks of poplar trees, or on
  the stems of bushes around, and is sometimes easily alarmed, and flies
  off on the collector's approach, whilst at other times it sits quietly,
  and may be easily boxed. At dusk it may be seen flying around the
  poplars.</p>

  <p>Widely distributed in the southern half of England, and only found
  where poplars, chiefly aspens, are well established. From Worcester its
  range extends northwards to Staffordshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire,
  and Cheshire; and it has been recorded from Yorkshire and Cumberland;
  also from Glamorganshire, South Wales. In Scotland it seems not to have
  been noted in the south, but is found more or less frequently from
  Perthshire to Sutherlandshire. Rare in Ireland.</p>

  <p>Abroad, its range extends to Amurland and Japan. <!-- Page 156
  --><span class="pagenum" title="224.png"><a
  name="page156"></a>{156}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Small Seraphim</b> (<i>Lobophora</i> (<i>Mysticoptera</i>) <i>sexalisata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is a much smaller species than the last. The fore wings are
  whitish, with brownish-grey, or blackish-grey, cross lines and bands; the
  central most distinct towards the front margin, where it encloses a black
  dot; hind wings greyish, with black central dot. (Plate <a
  href="#plate58">58</a>, Figs. 1 and 2.)</p>

  <p>The green, much wrinkled caterpillar has three whitish lines or
  stripes along the back, and in some examples there is a white line low
  down along the sides; the head, which inclines to yellowish, is notched,
  and there are two pinkish points on the last ring of the body. It feeds
  on sallow in August and September.</p>

  <p>The moth is to be found in May and June, and, in some years, again in
  July and August. It inhabits woods and hedgerows where sallow is
  plentiful, but, perhaps, is obtained more freely in fens. Occasionally it
  may be beaten from the hedges, but it is active on the wing just before
  the close of day, and then disports itself over and about the sallow
  bushes. It occurs in suitable localities in most of the eastern and
  southern counties of England, and has been reported from some of the
  northern ones, and from Glamorganshire, in South Wales. Kane states that
  it has been found in the north, south, east, and west of Ireland, but is
  always local and scarce.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;Prout considers this species to be
  the <i>sexalata</i> of Retzius (1783).</p>

<h5><b>Winter Moth</b> (<i>Cheimatobia brumata</i>).</h5>

  <p>In orchards and gardens wherein are fruit trees one may have noticed
  that the trunks of the trees have broad bands around them. If these bands
  are examined, they will be seen <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum" title="225.png"
  ><a name="page157"></a>{157}</span>to be covered with a sticky compound,
  which has been put there for the purpose of trapping the almost wingless
  females of the Winter Moth, as they crawl up the tree after emergence
  from the chrysalis. In spite of such devices, and other precautionary
  measures taken to safeguard the trees from attack, the foliage of apple,
  pear, etc., will not be quite free from the caterpillars of this species
  in their season.</p>

  <p>The male has greyish brown fore wings, which are crossed by rather
  darker lines, and a dark, more or less distinct, central band (ab.
  <i>hyemata</i>, Huene). The ground colour is very much darker in some
  specimens than in others, and examples of a sooty brown colour are not
  infrequent; Barrett mentions an almost buff-coloured specimen. In the
  female, the tiny affairs representing wings are brownish, with
  indications of a darker band towards the outer margin of the front
  pair.</p>

  <p>A small, purplish brown form, reared in January, 1882, from
  caterpillars found in Cumberland, feeding on sweet gale (<i>Myrica
  gale</i>), was described as a new species under the name
  <i>myricaria</i>, Cooke (<i>Entom.</i>, xv. 57). This has been referred
  by Staudinger to <i>C. boreata</i>, as a form of that species, but it is
  probably an aberration of <i>C. brumata.</i></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with a stripe of darker green along the
  back; on each side of this are two white lines, and along the black
  spiracles is a pale yellowish line; head, green, sometimes marked with
  blackish. It feeds on the foliage of trees and bushes, and sometimes
  abounds in April and May.</p>

  <p>The moth appears during the winter months, and has been noted as early
  as October and as late as February. (Plate <a href="#plate58">58</a>,
  Figs. 8-10.)</p>

  <p>Generally distributed throughout the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>Northern Winter Moth</b> (<i>Cheimatobia boreata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species is generally larger than the last-mentioned. The fore
  wings are marked somewhat as in that species, <!-- Page 158 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="226.png"><a name="page158"></a>{158}</span>but
  they are paler in colour and more glossy; hind wings whitish and glossy.
  In the female, the wings are useless for flying, but still they are
  larger than those of <i>brumata</i>. The front pair have a blackish band.
  (Plate <a href="#plate58">58</a>, Figs. 6 and 7 &#x2642;, 5 &#x2640;;
  ova. Plate <a href="#plate59">59</a>, Fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greenish, with a greyish stripe along the back,
  another edged above with yellow along the black spiracles, and a greyish
  line between the stripes; the head is black. It feeds, in May and June,
  on birch, and the moth does not appear until October or November.</p>

  <p>At one time considered to be a purely northern species: the earliest
  known British specimens, four in number, having been captured at Petty
  Pool, Delamere, Cheshire, on October 31, 1848. It is now known, however,
  to have a wide distribution in the south of England. Northwards, its
  range extends throughout England and Scotland up to Moray. It is found in
  South Wales; also in Galway, Monaghan, and Connemara, in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Tissue</b> (<i>Triphosa dubitata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this glossy species (Plate <a
  href="#plate60">60</a>, Figs. 1, 2) are pale brown, tinged more or less
  strongly with rosy or purplish; there are numerous darker and paler cross
  lines, the most distinct and constant being the blackish basal, and the
  two forming the edges of the central band; the latter are marked with
  black; the submarginal line is whitish, wavy, and sometimes broken up
  into dots. The species varies considerably in tint, some specimens
  inclining to pale greyish brown, others to smoky brown. Hind wings,
  whitish grey, with several darker grey cross lines; in dark specimens
  these wings are smoky grey. Ab. <i>cinereata</i>, Stephens, is a small
  pale greyish form, almost without rosy tinge and with fewer cross
  lines.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate62">62</a>, Fig. 1) is yellowish
  green with <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum" title="227.png"><a
  name="page159"></a>{159}</span>darker green stripes and lines. In another
  form there are four pale yellowish lines along the back and a yellow
  stripe low down along the sides. It feeds on buckthorn (<i>Rhamnus</i>),
  the leaves of which it fastens together with silk, and so forms a
  retreat. It will also eat sloe and bird-cherry (<i>Prunus padus</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth is out in August and through the autumn, when it sometimes
  visits the flowers of ivy, ragwort, etc.; after hibernation it is again
  seen, perhaps even more frequently, in April and May, and is then
  occasionally found at sallow catkins. The species seems to have been
  noted from nearly all the English counties, but becomes rare from
  Yorkshire northwards. In Wales, and in Ireland, it is apparently widely
  distributed, but in Scotland it seems confined to southern localities,
  and is only rarely met with.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the distribution spreads to Amurland, China, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Scarce Tissue</b> (<i>Eucosmia</i> (<i>Calocalpe</i>) <i>certata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species is very similar to the last, but the wings are not
  glossy, only reddish on the outer margin, and the black marked lines
  edging the central band of the fore wings are less irregular, the inner
  ones usually being much straighter. On the under side of the hind wings
  of the male is a fold enclosing hairs; this is on the inner margin, just
  above the anal angle. (Plate <a href="#plate60">60</a>, Fig. 3
  &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The thickset caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate62">62</a>, Fig. 3,
  after Hofmann) is greyish inclining to greenish; four white lines along
  the back, the central pair enclosing a dark line, the others are bordered
  below with dark greyish; the black spiracles are set in yellowish
  blotches, and the plates on first and last rings are brown; head,
  reddish-brown, glossy (adapted from Fenn). It feeds on the barberry
  (<i>Berberis vulgaris</i>) and the holly-leaved barberry (<i>B.
  aquifolium</i>) grown in gardens, in June and July. The moth <!-- Page
  160 --><span class="pagenum" title="228.png"><a
  name="page160"></a>{160}</span>is out in May and June, but in favourable
  seasons has appeared in late April. When on the wing at night it is
  freely attracted by light, but otherwise not often noticed. The species
  has occurred in many of the English counties from Devon to Durham, but it
  seems to be only common in the eastern counties, and most frequent
  perhaps in Suffolk. It has been recorded from South Wales, but is
  seemingly absent from Ireland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Scallop Shell</b> (<i>Eucosmia undulata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Wings pale greyish, sometimes ochreous tinted, and crossed by numerous
  dark-grey wavy lines inclining to blackish on the front margin of the
  fore wings; the waves of the central pair of lines on the fore wings
  often meet and so form a series of rings; sometimes the space between the
  eighth and twelfth lines is of a dusky hue, and occasionally it is
  distinctly darker and band-like; the outer margin of all the wings is
  brownish and traversed by a wavy white line. The male has tufts of
  blackish hair in a fold on the inner margin of the hind wing, this is
  noticeable on the upper side, but is best seen from the under side.
  (Plate <a href="#plate60">60</a>, Figs. 4 &#x2642;, 5 &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The somewhat dumpy caterpillar is reddish-brown with four yellowish
  lines along the back; a greyish stripe along the sides, and a creamy
  stripe along the black spiracles; head, pale brown and glossy. It feeds
  on sallow, aspen, and bilberry, and may be found from August throughout
  the autumn in spun-together leaves at the tips of the shoots. (Plate <a
  href="#plate62">62</a>, Fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, and occurs in woods where there is a
  good growth of bilberry, or in marshy spots where sallow bushes
  abound.</p>

  <p>In England the species is widely distributed over the southern and
  eastern counties; its range extends through the Midlands to Cheshire,
  Lancs., and Westmorland, rarely in Lincoln and Yorks., and once recorded
  in Durham; it occurs in Wales and in Scotland, but only in the more
  southern part of each country. It is not plentiful in Ireland, but widely
  distributed. The range abroad includes Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>The Brown Scallop</b> (<i>Scotosia vetulata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The male is always smaller than the female, and is noticeable for its
  long body with tuft of hairs at the extremity. The wings in both sexes
  are dingy brown, or greyish brown, and the usual lines on fore wings are
  blackish, the space between first and second often dusky. (Plate <a
  href="#plate60">60</a>, Fig. 6.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is short and stout, and in form very like that of the
  winter moth; the back and a central dorsal stripe are black, the latter
  bordered with white, the sides are yellow; the spiracular line is black,
  broken, and unconnected; the spiracles are black; the head is black, and
  the edge of the first ring of the body is yellow. (Crewe.) It feeds, in
  May and June, on purging buckthorn (<i>Rhamnus catharticus</i>), and is
  to be found between two or more leaves, which it spins together as a
  hiding place.</p>

  <p>In June and July the moth may sometimes be obtained by beating bushes
  of buckthorn, or the herbage below and around; this plan works best when
  operated just before dusk. As a British insect it is only found in
  England, and is most frequent in the southern and eastern counties, but
  widely distributed in the west to Worcester, and has been found in
  Lancashire, Westmorland, and Yorks. In the last-named county,
  caterpillars were obtained freely at Askham Bogs in 1900.</p>

  <p>When Stephens wrote of this insect in 1831 he noted its occurrence "in
  a lane near Fulham." Even so recently as 1906 I obtained specimens on the
  Putney side of Wimbledon Common.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Eastern Siberia. <!-- Page 162 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="232.png"><a name="page162"></a>{162}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Dark Umber</b> (<i>Scotosia rhamnata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The blackish oblique band on the fore wings of this ochreous brown
  species (Plate <a href="#plate60">60</a>, Fig. 7 &#x2642;, 8 &#x2640;) is
  sometimes indicated only by the blackish lines, the space between them
  being hardly darker than the general colour. Sometimes all the wings are
  suffused with blackish brown, and in such specimens the only distinct
  marking is the whitish submarginal line.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with three lines along the back, the central
  one dark green, and the others yellow; the hind wings are marked with
  purple, and a stripe of the same colour runs along under the spiracles.
  In another form the general colour is greyish with a reddish-brown stripe
  along the back, and series of spots of the same colour along the sides.
  It may be found in May and June, concealed between leaves that it has
  fastened together to form a retreat.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in late June and in July, and may be disturbed in the
  daytime from buckthorn bushes. It is widely distributed, and often common
  in the South of England, but is rare in the north; and has also been
  recorded from South Wales.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note</span>.&mdash;This species has been referred to
  <i>transversata</i>, Hufnagel, and as this is an earlier name it may have
  to be adopted. According to Prout, both this and the preceding species
  should be placed in the genus <i>Philereme</i>, Hübner.</p>

<h5><b>Small Ph&oelig;nix</b> (<i>Eustroma silaceata</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form (Plate <a href="#plate63">63</a>, Fig. 3) the
  blackish band of the fore wings is entire, but in ab. <i>insulata</i>,
  Haworth (Fig. 4), this band is interrupted by two whitish lines along the
  median veins, and so divided into three or four portions, the smaller
  section placed between the lines; occasionally, the dividing lines assume
  stripe-like proportions, and the main portions are consequently smaller
  in size and further from each other, but one "island" still remains. In
  another form, the lower outer corner is distinctly separate from the
  costal portion; thus the band is broken into four parts.</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar is green, with a reddish-brown stripe along the
  back; this is broken up into spots, except on the first three rings;
  there are some reddish-brown spots on the sides. It feeds on various
  kinds of willow herb (<i>Epilobium</i>), and enchanter's nightshade
  (<i>Circæa lutetiana</i>) in July, and sometimes in August and
  September.</p>

  <p>The moth should be looked for in beech and other woods amongst the
  food plants, from which, and the surrounding herbage, it is readily
  evicted. It flies at twilight, and later on, when it has been known to
  visit the sugar patch; it is also attracted by light. It is out in May
  and June, and specimens of a second generation sometimes occur in the
  South. The species occurs locally throughout England, probably Wales, and
  in Scotland up to Ross. In Ireland, it is widely distributed and locally
  common in the North, but apparently not noted in the South.</p>

<h5><b>Netted Carpet</b> (<i>Lygris reticulata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The white veins and white lines passing through the blackish blotches
  at the base and on the front margin of the fore wings, give these wings a
  curious netted appearance; the hind wings are smoky grey, with two white
  lines which appear to be continuations of the white second line and
  sub-marginal of the fore wings. (Plate <a href="#plate61">61</a>, Fig.
  1.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, inclining to yellowish, and more or less
  tinged with pinkish, especially on the sides; three lines on the back,
  the central one reddish, the others whitish; a central line along the
  pinkish spiracles. It feeds at night on yellow balsam (<i>Impatiens
  noli-me-tangere</i>), preferring the flowers, <!-- Page 164 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="236.png"><a name="page164"></a>{164}</span>seeds,
  and young foliage, and rests by day on the undersides of the leaves:
  September and October. (Plate <a href="#plate64">64</a>, Fig. 2, after
  Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, and, of course, will only be found
  in localities where the balsam flourishes; these are very limited, and in
  Britain are confined to Westmorland and the northern border of
  Lancashire, and North Wales. The species was first introduced as British
  in 1861, when the late Henry Doubleday recorded the capture of three
  specimens in August, 1856, on the border of one of the lakes in
  Westmorland, by his friend the late Thomas H. Allis. It seems that other
  specimens had been taken at the same time, but these passed into
  collections as the "second brood of <i>silacearia</i>." The caterpillar
  is said to have been found in North Wales, but has been more frequently
  obtained in the English Lake District.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Eastern Siberia, Amurland, Corea, and
  Japan; but in the three last-named countries it is chiefly represented by
  var. <i>ærosa</i>, Butt., a large form.</p>

<h5><b>The Ph&oelig;nix</b> (<i>Lygris prunata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The English name here retained was given to this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate63">63</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;) by Harris, in 1775,
  but in 1782 he changed it to "Clouded Carpet."</p>

  <p>In ground colour the fore wings are pale brown, more or less clouded
  with darker brown, or with reddish-brown; the basal patch, central band,
  and blotch on outer margin below the tip of the wing, are all chocolate
  brown clouded with blackish and edged with white. Hind wings, whitish,
  suffused with smoky grey, except on front area; three dusky whitish-edged
  wavy lines, inclining to blackish on the inner margin. The egg (Plate <a
  href="#plate67">67</a>, Fig. 3) is yellowish when laid, and then changes
  to purplish with a whitish bloom.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, varying to brownish; along the <!-- Page 165
  --><span class="pagenum" title="237.png"><a
  name="page165"></a>{165}</span>middle of the back is a series of
  purplish-edged, brown-centred, whitish, triangular markings; the third
  ring is swollen, and has a black collar. It feeds at night on the foliage
  of red and black currant, also on gooseberry, and may be found in April
  and May, earlier or later according to season, sitting by day upon the
  bushes.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in July and August, and occurs in gardens, but is said
  to be partial to sloe bushes and hedges. It is always more or less local,
  although it is distributed over the greater part of the British
  Isles.</p>

  <p>This species occurs in the Northern United States of America.</p>

<h5><b>The Chevron</b> (<i>Lygris testata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this rather variable species (Plate <a
  href="#plate63">63</a>, Figs. 5-7) are yellowish or reddish grey, with a
  darker basal patch and central band; a reddish blotch below the tip of
  the wing is edged with white, and the central band is also outwardly
  edged with white. Hind wings, whitish, with two lines, and dusky hind
  marginal border, the latter sometimes inclining to reddish. Occasionally,
  the fore wings are entirely pale ochreous, and the basal patch and the
  central band only very slightly darker, but the limiting lines are
  reddish, and the patch under the tip of the wing is bright orange red.
  Var. <i>insulicola</i>, Staud., from the isles of Scotland, has the fore
  wings rather narrower, and suffused with purplish brown or deep violet
  grey; the hind wings are smoky grey. The female is usually smaller than
  the male, and often more yellow in colour.</p>

  <p>Eggs, whitish brown, mottled with darker. The early stages are shown
  on Plate <a href="#plate67">67</a>, Figs. 2-2<i>b</i>.</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar is pale yellowish brown, with three lines along
  the back, the central one dark brown, and most distinct at each end; the
  others are white, irregularly shaded above <!-- Page 166 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="238.png"><a name="page166"></a>{166}</span>with
  reddish; another white line along the region of the spiracles. It feeds,
  in May or June (earlier or later in some seasons), on sallow and birch.
  The moth is out in July and August, and frequents heaths and bogs more
  especially, but is also found in or around woods, and I have captured
  male specimens as they flew along hedgerows bordering fields, at dusk, in
  Middlesex. The female is rarely seen on the wing.</p>

  <p>The species, which ranges through Central and Northern Europe to the
  Ural and Altai, is generally distributed throughout the British Isles; it
  is found also in the Atlantic States of America.</p>

<h5><b>Northern Spinach</b> (<i>Lygris populata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are yellow, with a reddish or purplish-brown basal
  patch, central band, and small patch on outer margin below tip of the
  wing, the central band more or less clouded or mottled with yellow. Hind
  wings, whitish, tinged with yellow. The female is usually smaller, the
  colour generally paler, and the markings frequently only represented by
  cross lines. Specimens from the Isle of Arran have the ground colour of
  fore wings more or less dappled with brown of the same tint as that of
  the central band and other markings; the hind wings are tinged with a
  smoky hue. In other parts of Scotland the brown colour becomes more and
  more general, until the fore wings are uniformly brown, and the hind
  wings dusky. On the mountains in the north nearly black specimens occur,
  and these seem to be referable to ab. <i>musauaria</i>, Freyer. (Plate <a
  href="#plate63">63</a>, Figs. 8-10.)</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar is variable in general colour, brown, mottled
  with greyish, pale grey, reddish brown, or yellowish green; all have
  darker or whitish lines along the back, and whitish or pinkish triangles
  or X-marks. It feeds, in May and June (earlier in some localities, and
  later in others), on bilberry, crowberry, and sallow; it may also be
  reared on willow.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, and may be found on the leaves and
  among the sprays of <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> growing in woodlands
  (especially the more ancient), bogs, and moorlands.</p>

  <p>The species is widely spread, and generally abundant in suitable
  districts, over the greater part of the British Isles; but it seems to be
  more or less casual in England south of the Midlands, although its range
  runs through Gloucestershire and Somerset into Devon. In the last-named
  county it sometimes swarms at Martinhoe, on the edge of Exmoor.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad includes Eastern Siberia, Amurland, Labrador,
  and North America.</p>

<h5><b>The Spinach</b> (<i>Lygris associata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are pale ochreous, more or less clouded with darker;
  three brownish cross lines. Hind wings, paler, with indication of cross
  lines on the inner margin. Fringes of all the wings chequered with brown,
  most distinct on the fore wings. (Plate <a href="#plate65">65</a>, Figs.
  1, 2.)</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar is green, inclining to yellowish; three lines
  along the back, the central one dark green and the others whitish; there
  is also a whitish line low down along the sides. It feeds at night, in
  May and June, on currant (<i>Ribes rubrum</i> and <i>R. nigrum</i>), and
  may be found on the underside of a leaf in the daytime. (Figured on Plate
  <a href="#plate67">67</a>, Fig. 1, from a coloured drawing by Mr. A.
  Sich.)</p>

  <p>During July and August the moth flies in the evening, and after dark
  it often comes to any bright illumination. It is essentially a garden
  insect, and where currant bushes are there also spinach is often grown;
  hence it was probably connected with the vegetable rather than the fruit
  when Haworth named it <i>spinachiata</i>. The species seems to be found
  more or less frequently in suitable spots through England. In Wales it
  has <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum" title="242.png"><a
  name="page168"></a>{168}</span>been recorded from Glamorganshire, and
  from Rhyl, Flintshire; in Scotland, Renton states that it is common in
  Roxburgh gardens; and it is also noted from Paisley. It has been
  doubtfully recorded from Ireland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Barred Straw</b> (<i>Cidaria pyraliata</i>).</h5>

  <p>In certain respects this species (Plate <a href="#plate65">65</a>,
  Figs. 3-5) is not unlike that last referred to. The fore wings are
  yellowish straw-colour, the cross lines are brownish, but the central two
  are closer together, especially on the inner margin, than they are in
  <i>associata</i>, and are straightly oblique from the angle, or elbow,
  below the front margin; there is often a line of brownish dots between
  the second line and the outer margin, and the fringes are brown, not
  chequered. Occasionally there are darker clouds on the second line, at
  the angle, and such clouds sometimes appear in the central space. Not
  infrequently the markings are very faint. Staudinger and others refer
  this species to <i>dotata</i>, L., but there seems to be some doubt in
  the matter.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds, in April and May, on the common cleavers or
  goose-grass (<i>Galium aparine</i>) of our hedgerows, etc., but it also
  eats <i>G. mollugo</i> and other kinds of bedstraw. It is to be found low
  down on the stems.</p>

  <p>The moth may be disturbed from the herbage along hedges and ditches in
  lanes, and the borders of woods, but it seems most partial to the
  former.</p>

  <p>The species is generally distributed, and often plentiful, in the
  southern half of England; but although widely spread in the northern
  half, it is only common locally. It occurs in Wales, both North and
  South; is common in Roxburghshire and Clydesdale, and is said to be found
  on the Aberdeenshire coast and in West Ross. In Ireland it is widely
  distributed, <!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum" title="243.png"><a
  name="page169"></a>{169}</span>and sometimes abundant; but more frequent
  on the coast than inland.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad includes Eastern Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Barred Yellow</b> (<i>Cidaria fulvata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This very pretty, and most distinct, little species (Plate <a
  href="#plate65">65</a>, Figs. 6, 7) does not vary very greatly; there is
  certainly some modification in the general colour, and in that of the
  markings, but in both it is only a matter of tint.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is somewhat wrinkled, and in colour is green, with
  three greyish lines along the back, the central one double; the ring
  divisions are yellow, and there is a yellow line low-down along the
  sides. It feeds at night, in May and June, on the leaves of wild rose,
  and does not object to the garden kinds. (Plate <a
  href="#plate69">69</a>, Fig. 3, after Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July. It hides by day under leaves in
  hedges, and although not often induced to get on the wing at that time,
  the male commences its evening flight at an early hour. It is generally a
  common species in England and Wales; it occurs here and there through
  Scotland, up to the Orkneys; and although somewhat local, it is common
  enough, where found, in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Broken-barred Carpet</b> (<i>Cidaria corylata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings have an olive-brown basal patch and central band, both
  are edged with white, wavy lines, and the band is contracted below the
  middle. (Plate <a href="#plate65">65</a>, Fig. 9), and often broken at
  this point (Fig. 10); the inner marginal portion sometimes very small;
  the space between the basal patch and central band is pale brown, and so
  also is the outer marginal area; but there are dark clouds and white
  marks beyond the <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum" title="244.png"
  ><a name="page170"></a>{170}</span>white wavy submarginal line. Variable
  in tint and in marking, the variety generally known as
  <i>albocrenata</i>, Curtis (Plate <a href="#plate65">65</a>, Fig. 8), is
  perhaps most frequent in Perthshire and Sutherland. Two other examples of
  the Scottish form, which Staudinger has named <i>effusaria</i>, are
  depicted on Plate <a href="#plate61">61</a>, Figs. 8, 9.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, inclining to yellowish; three stripes on the
  back, the central one reddish brown and broad, but only distinct at each
  end, the other paler green; spiracles, white, placed in a reddish-brown
  stripe, which is sometimes broken up. It feeds on sloe, birch, oak, and
  the foliage of other trees, and may be found from July to September, and
  even later.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and is to be beaten from hedges, or
  may be found at rest on tree-trunks, palings, etc.</p>

  <p>Generally distributed, but not extending to the Scottish Isles.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range spreads to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Common Marbled Carpet</b> (<i>Cidaria truncata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Six examples of this very variable species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate66">66</a>, and these have been selected to illustrate the
  more important forms. There are a number of modifications of each of the
  forms, and several of these have been named. Fig. 1 of our plate
  represents the typical form, and this is Haworth's <i>centumnotata</i>
  (Common Marbled Carpet); Fig. 2 is ab. <i>commanotata</i> of Haworth
  (Yellow Marbled Carpet); Fig. 3 is ab. <i>perfuscata</i>, Haworth (The
  Brown Marbled Carpet), and Fig. 4 is a modification of the same form. A
  specimen from Arran is shown in Fig. 5; this example agrees fairly well
  with that figured in Wood's <i>Index</i> as <i>concinnata</i> from Arran.
  In his description of the form, Stephens does not mention fulvous bands
  in his type. Fig. 6 shows a specimen from Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, which
  appears to be a modification of the typical form of <i>truncata</i>, but
  it has some of the character of <i>concinnata</i>. The latter, it may be
  mentioned, is considered by Mr. L. B. Prout to be a distinct species, and
  as the genitalia have been found, on examination by Mr. Pierce, to differ
  from these organs in <i>truncata</i> and <i>immanata</i>, there seems to
  be reason to accept it as such.</p>

<p><!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum" title="247.png"><a name="page171"></a>{171}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is long, slender, and wrinkled, especially on the
  sides; the ground colour is green, inclining to yellowish; three lines
  along the back, the central one dark green, and the others yellowish;
  sometimes a rosy stripe, or a series of dashes along the sides; the
  points on the last ring are green, or rosy. It feeds, in the autumn and
  again in the spring after hibernation, on sallow, birch, hawthorn,
  bilberry, wild strawberry, etc. It will also eat rose, but as the
  specimens resulting from caterpillars reared on rose are frequently
  small, such food is probably unsuitable; garden strawberry, on the other
  hand, is an excellent pabulum. A photograph of the caterpillar by Mr. H.
  Main is shown on Plate <a href="#plate69">69</a>, Fig. 1. There is a
  second brood in late June and in July. The first generation of the moth
  is out in May and June, and the second emerges in the autumn; specimens,
  possibly of a third generation, have been seen in December in favourable
  localities.</p>

  <p>The species, which frequents woods and hedgerows, and is pretty
  generally common, is to be found almost everywhere throughout the British
  Isles. It has not, however, been noted from Shetland.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad extends to Amurland, China, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Dark Marbled Carpet</b> (<i>Cidaria immanata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is another exceedingly variable species (Plate <a
  href="#plate66">66</a>), and here again six examples have been chosen to
  illustrate something of the range of aberration. Figs. 7 and 8 are of the
  <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum" title="248.png"><a
  name="page172"></a>{172}</span>typical form, and Figs. 9 and 10 show the
  form <i>marmorata</i>, Haworth (Marbled Carpet); while Figs. 11 and 12
  represent specimens from Shetland, and are referable to the island race
  known as <i>pythonissata</i>, Millière; neither of the specimens figured,
  however, quite agrees with the type of this form, but Fig. 12 does so
  fairly well. In some specimens the general colour of the fore wings is
  tawny or rust-colour, or they are strongly suffused with that tint (ab.
  <i>ferruginea</i>, Prout). I have such examples in my series of specimens
  from Lewes and the Shetlands. Ab. <i>thingvallata</i>, Staud., from
  Iceland, has the fore wings white, with black basal patch and central
  band, and I have seen at least one example from Yorkshire that closely
  approached this variety.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is not very unlike that of the last species, but it is
  rounder in appearance, the general green colour is paler, and the points
  on the last ring are blunt. It feeds from April to June on sallow, birch,
  bilberry, and wild strawberry. (Plate <a href="#plate69">69</a>, Fig. 2,
  after Hofmann.) The moths are out in July and August, and may be found
  resting on tree-trunks, rocks, or stone walls; at night, when it is
  active on the wing, it is said to be often seen in numbers on the flowers
  of the rush, and this habit has been noted more particularly in
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>The species affects woods and moors, and appears to be found more or
  less commonly throughout the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>Marsh Carpet</b> (<i>Cidaria sagittata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this very distinct species are brown, with
  white-edged black bands at base and across the central area, the latter
  with a strong projection on its outer edge, almost reaching a white spot
  on the outer margin; sub-marginal line whitish, often only traceable on
  the front edge. The central band is always narrowed below the middle,
  sometimes divided, <!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum" title="249.png"
  ><a name="page173"></a>{173}</span>and occasionally this part of the band
  is finely cut off from both upper and lower portions. (Plate <a
  href="#plate68">68</a>, Figs. 7, 8.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish green, merging into pinkish on the sides;
  the pink is edged below with black, and this is followed by a dark olive
  stripe; rings 1-3 and 10-12 are wrinkled, whilst all the others are
  ridged across the back and along the sides. It feeds, in August and
  September, on the unripe seeds of meadow-rue (<i>Thalictrum flavum</i>),
  also on <i>T. minus</i>, and, according to Barrett, on old withered
  leaves of columbine.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July, occasionally at the end of June, and occurs
  locally in "Fenland."</p>

  <p>Doubleday introduced it as British in the <i>Zoologist</i> for 1848.
  He there states, "A single example of this pretty species was obtained
  last season near Peterborough, but I believe it was not in very good
  condition. A splendid female was sent to me from the same neighbourhood
  this week (July 15, 1848)."</p>

  <p>In 1853 and 1854 the species was discovered in the fens of
  Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire. Later it was found to inhabit the
  fens of Norfolk and Suffolk. It is still obtained in the Cambridge fens
  from Bottisham to Chatteris. Outside "Fenland" it has been recorded from
  Worcestershire (Bewdley Forest) and Warwickshire (Rugby).</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Red-green Carpet</b> (<i>Cidaria siterata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The general colour of the fore wings of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate68">68</a>, Figs. 1-4) is greyish green, with more or less of
  rosy suffusion; the basal patch and central band are darker green, and
  the latter is outwardly edged with whitish below the front margin, and
  towards the inner margin. The female has rather more ample wings, and is
  generally of a darker hue, but in both sexes the basal patch and central
  band are blackish; the hind <!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum" title="250.png"
  ><a name="page174"></a>{174}</span>wings are dark greyish brown,
  inclining to blackish in some females, and there is a blackish central
  dot and two or three curved lines.</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar is yellowish green, with an interrupted red line
  along the middle of the back; two green points on last ring are usually
  pink-tipped. It feeds on oak, birch, ash, sloe, apple, etc., in July and
  August.</p>

  <p>The moth occurs in woodlands, but is not easily disturbed in the
  daytime from its lurking-place in bush or tree. In the autumn it may be
  found at ivy-bloom, and in the spring, after hibernation, has been taken
  at sallow.</p>

  <p>The species appears to be widely distributed over England and Wales,
  Scotland up to Moray, and Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Autumn Green Carpet</b> (<i>Cidaria miata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Somewhat similar to the last, but the general colour of the fore wings
  is paler, inclining to whitish, and the basal patch and central band are
  pale green tinged with greyish; there is no rosy suffusion, but the wavy
  sub-marginal line is distinctly white. The hind wings are greyish white,
  with black discal dot, and dark-grey curved lines. (Plate <a
  href="#plate68">68</a>, Figs. 5, 6.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale green, inclining to yellowish, especially
  between the rings, and with a more or less distinct dark-green line along
  the middle of the back; the points on the last ring are pinkish brown,
  and there is a line of the same colour along the centre of the under
  surface of the body.</p>

  <p>It feeds on alder, birch, oak, sallow, etc., and may be beaten out
  from June to August.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in September and October, when it may be obtained at
  ivy-bloom, and in the following spring, after hibernation, it visits
  sallow catkins.</p>

  <p>The range in the British Isles agrees pretty closely with that of the
  last species, but in Scotland it extends to the Hebrides and to the
  Orkneys.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;According to Prout,
  <i>sagittata</i> is not a <i>Cidaria</i>, as its larva is of a very
  different form; and <i>siterata</i> and <i>miata</i> are referred to
  <i>Chloroclysta</i>, Hübner.</p>

<h5><b>Grey Pine Carpet</b> (<i>Thera variata</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form, the fore wings of this species are greyish, and
  from this the colour ranges through various tints of greyish brown to
  smoky brown or blackish; sometimes these wings are shades of ochreous
  brown. The usual markings are a basal patch, more or less clearly
  defined, and a central band, and these may be either brown or blackish;
  the band varies in width, is not infrequently narrowed or contracted
  below the middle, occasionally broken at this point, and more rarely only
  represented by a small angular spot near the front margin.</p>

  <p>Four examples are shown on Plate <a href="#plate70">70</a>, and of
  these 1 and 2 represent our ordinary form <i>obeliscata</i>, Hübner
  (Shaded Broad Bar, of Newman). Fig. 6 is a blackish banded specimen of
  the <i>obeliscata</i> form, and Fig. 3 is the almost entirely blackish
  form <i>obliterata</i>, White (<i>scotica</i>, Staud.), which is not
  uncommon in the Paisley district, and other parts of Scotland, and also
  occurs in a modified form in some pine-woods in the South of England.</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate71">71</a>, Fig. 1), which
  feeds on the needles of Scots pine in April and May, also in July, and
  sometimes in September, is bright green, with three whitish lines along
  the back, the central one broad, and a yellowish line low down along the
  sides; the green roundish head is lined with white.</p>

  <p>The moth is generally common in pine-woods throughout the greater part
  of the British Isles. The May-June flight is the most abundant, but there
  is occasionally a good sprinkling of moths in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the area of distribution includes Eastern Siberia, Corea,
  China, and Japan. <!-- Page 176 --><span class="pagenum" title="254.png"
  ><a name="page176"></a>{176}</span></p>

<h5><b>Chestnut-coloured Carpet</b> (<i>Thera cognata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is a generally smaller species than that last referred to, and it
  is more glossy in appearance. The fore wings are brown, sometimes
  grey-brown, more or less tinged with reddish, and the basal patch and
  central band are darker; these markings are usually white-edged, and
  there is a wavy whitish submarginal line. Hind wings whitish, tinged with
  smoky grey. Specimens from the Hebrides are strongly purplish; and Kane
  states that some he reared from Sligo caterpillars are more richly
  coloured than any that he has seen from Scotland. (Plate <a
  href="#plate70">70</a>, Figs. 9 &#x2642; 12 &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The bright green caterpillar is stouter than that of the last species.
  It is of a bluish hue along the back, and marked with three lines, the
  central one greenish and the others whitish and broad; there are
  sometimes reddish markings low down on the sides, just edging the broad
  white spiracular line. It feeds in May and June, earlier or later in some
  seasons, on juniper; it turns to a dark-green chrysalis in a frail cocoon
  spun up among the litter under the juniper bushes.</p>

  <p>The moth is to be found in July and August among juniper growing in
  the hilly and maritime haunts of the species in North England, Wales,
  Scotland, and Ireland.</p>

  <p>This species, long known as <i>simulata</i>, Hübner, has been referred
  to <i>cognata</i>, Thunberg, and as this is an earlier name it will have
  to be used.</p>

<h5><b>Pine Carpet</b> (<i>Thera firmata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The pale reddish-grey fore wings have a rather darker central band and
  round-edged basal patch, but the latter is often indistinct, and the
  band, which is always deeply indented about the middle of its inner edge,
  is sometimes not well defined. The hind wings are whitish, tinged more or
  less with greyish or pale brownish, but always paler than in any form of
  <i>T. variata</i>, with which it is often confused. (Plate <a
  href="#plate70">70</a>, Figs. 10, 11.)</p>

<p><!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum" title="257.png"><a name="page177"></a>{177}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is bluish-green above, and green beneath; three lines
  along the back, the central one a darker tone of the ground colour, the
  others whitish; head reddish, marked with brown on each cheek. It feeds
  in April and May (June in Scotland) on Scots pine; Barrett states that
  there is a second brood in August. (Plate <a href="#plate71">71</a>, Fig.
  2.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in September and October, and may be disturbed from
  the pine boughs, or occasionally seen resting on the trunks, but it is
  more frequently met with at night when it flies naturally, and has been
  known to visit the sugar patch. Barrett, who considered this species to
  be double brooded, gives June and July for the first flight of moths.
  Certain it is that moths have been reared even as late as October from
  Spring caterpillars. As adverted to, the pale reddish forms of <i>T.
  variata</i> are sometimes confused with <i>T. firmata</i>, but in
  addition to other differences indicated above, it may be noted that in
  the male of the latter the antennæ are bipectinated except towards the
  tips. Most of the pine woods throughout England seem to produce this
  delicate insect more or less frequently; the same remark applies to
  Wales. In Scotland it is found up to Aberdeen, and also in the Hebrides.
  The only localities mentioned by Kane for Ireland are in counties
  Westmeath, Dublin, and Fermanagh.</p>

<h5><b>Juniper Carpet</b> (<i>Thera juniperata</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate70">70</a>, Figs. 4 and 5 represent the sexes
  of the typical form of this species, the small and rather more strongly
  marked Scottish form is shown by Figs. 7 and 8. In these small forms a
  noticeable character is the brownish band on the fore wings, between the
  central band and the outer margin; this band is <!-- Page 178 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="258.png"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span>only
  indicated by a dusky greyish shade in the larger form. Most of the
  examples of the small form from the Isle of Hoy have also a dark central
  line on the hind wings. The central band of the fore wings is often
  broken below the middle, in both forms.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish green, inclining to a black tinge on the
  back, along which are three lines, the central one dark green, and the
  others yellow and rather broad; a whitish stripe low down along the sides
  is sometimes marked with yellow and red, and there is a red thread above
  it; head, pink tinged; two points on last ring of the body. It feeds in
  July and August, on juniper. The moth is out in October and November, and
  may be found plentifully flying at night about the juniper bushes.</p>

  <p>Berkshire, Kent, Surrey, and Sussex appear to be the only English
  counties in which it is established, and it is probably most plentiful in
  the last named. It has, however, been recorded from Suffolk, Lancashire,
  York, and Durham; also from Carnarvonshire in North Wales. It is more
  widely spread throughout Scotland, including the Orkneys and Shetlands,
  where the moths fly in July. Only doubtfully reported from Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Water Carpet</b> (<i>Lampropteryx suffumata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are whitish, more or less clouded with brownish, with
  dark brown, inclining to blackish, basal patch and central band. The
  variation tends in two opposite directions; in the one the general colour
  is so clouded and suffused with blackish-brown, that the entire fore
  wings become almost entirely of that colour (ab. <i>piceata</i>,
  Stephens), N. England and Scotland; the other extreme is ab.
  <i>porrittii</i>, Robson, in which the central band and basal patch are
  black, and the white ground colour is almost free of brown clouding; the
  last named occurs at Dover <!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum" title="259.png"
  ><a name="page179"></a>{179}</span>in Kent, and Huddersfield, Yorks. On
  Plate <a href="#plate72">72</a>, Fig. 1 shows the typical form, Fig. 3
  ab. <i>piceata</i>, and 2 ab. <i>porrittii</i>. The caterpillar varies
  from greyish, with pinkish or greenish tinge, to ochreous brown; the
  upper surface is rather darker than the under, and there is a series of
  dark V-shaped marks and arrow-heads on the back of rings 4-8; there is a
  whitish central stripe on 1-3, and a dark one on 9-12; head, brownish,
  marked with black. It feeds on goose-grass (<i>Galium aparine</i>), and
  other kinds of bedstraw, in May and early June. It seems to thrive best,
  however, on the goose-grass. (Plate <a href="#plate74">74</a>, Fig. 1,
  after Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>The moth may be found in weedy lanes and along hedgerows, pretty well
  throughout England, Wales, Scotland to Moray, and Ireland. It cannot,
  however, be said to occur in all suitable places, as although it may be
  found in some plenty in one lane or hedgerow in a district, it may be
  quite absent in similar spots just around. Wherever it is noted one year
  it may be almost certainly obtained there in subsequent years. April and
  May are the months in which it is usually seen, but it has been taken in
  June in late seasons, and occasionally in July.</p>

<h5><b>Large Twin-spot Carpet</b> (<i>Coremia</i> (<i>Ochyria</i>) <i>quadrifasciaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour of the fore wings of this species is most often of a
  pale reddish brown, but sometimes it inclines to grey brown; the
  outwardly angled central band is often black, but more frequently perhaps
  the middle area is pretty much of the ground colour or greyish, with a
  black dot in the upper portion, and limited by two black lines which
  approach, or join, in the lower half. A dusky basal blotch is not always
  present, but it is sometimes well in evidence, as also is a dusky shade
  before the whitish submarginal line; frequently there are two blackish
  <!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum" title="260.png"><a
  name="page180"></a>{180}</span>or brownish dots on the upper part of this
  line, and a third dot above them, but nearer the outer margin. (Plate <a
  href="#plate72">72</a>, Figs. 4, 5.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale yellowish brown, finely freckled with grey,
  and with greyish V-shaped marks on the back; three greyish lines along
  the back, the central one broken, and the others most distinct at each
  end. It feeds on bedstraw (<i>Galium</i>) and other plants, such as
  primrose, groundsel, etc., from August to April. The moth is out in June
  and July, and should be looked for on tree-trunks growing around the
  borders of woods or in lanes near by. It may also be beaten out of
  hedgerows in the vicinity of woods.</p>

  <p>A very local species and only found with us in the southern half of
  England. Its chief haunts appear to be in the counties of Kent, Surrey,
  Hants, Essex, Suffolk, Cambridge, and Norfolk (the Breck sand district);
  thence its range extends through Hertford, Buckingham, and Berkshire to
  Gloucester, where, however, it is scarce, as it is also in Lincoln.
  Abroad, the range extends to Eastern Siberia, Amurland, Corea and
  Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Red Carpet</b> (<i>Coremia</i> (<i>Ochyria</i>) <i>munitata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The typical form (Plate <a href="#plate72">72</a>, Fig. 6) has pale
  greyish fore wings, and these are crossed by a black-edged purplish
  central band. In var. <i>hethlandica</i>, Prout (Fig. 7), the ground
  colour is ochreous and the band is reddish; this form is frequent in the
  Shetlands.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish green, with greyish clouds around white
  dots, tinged with pink between the rings; three lines along the back, the
  central one grey inclining to blackish, broken on three of the hinder
  rings, and edged with whitish; the others are double, wavy, brownish, a
  whitish stripe bordered above with grey along the area of the spiracles;
  head, ochreous, dotted with dark brown (adapted from Fenn). It feeds on
  lady's mantle (<i>Alchemilla</i>), chickweed, groundsel, etc., from
  September to May.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, and in England is only found in
  the mountain districts of Yorkshire and the more northern centres. It has
  been reported from the high-lying district on the border of Cheshire,
  between Macclesfield and Buxton (Day), and from Llantrissant,
  Glamorganshire, S. Wales (Evan John). Generally distributed through
  Scotland and the Isles. Widely spread, but local, and not always common,
  in Ireland.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Eastern Siberia, Amurland and North
  America.</p>

<h5><b>Dark-barred Twin-spot Carpet</b> (<i>Coremia</i> (<i>Ochyria</i>) <i>unidentaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Portraits of three examples of this species will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate75">75</a>, Figs. 1-3. The ground colour of the fore wings is
  whitish tinged with pale ochreous or greyish; the central band is
  blackish with darker wavy lines running through it near the edges, and
  not infrequently the middle area is greyish, either on the upper half, or
  throughout from front to inner margins; a narrow patch at the base of the
  wings is of the same colour as the central band, and is followed by a
  reddish-brown streak; as a rule, there is an irregular reddish-brown
  line, commencing in a cloud on the front margin, and sometimes
  stripe-like, beyond the pale edging of the central band; in ab.
  <i>coarctata</i>, Prout, the central band is much narrowed; the two black
  dots on upper part of the outer margin, generally well in evidence, are
  occasionally united, but sometimes they are very tiny. The hind wings are
  whitish, more or less sprinkled with dusky scales, chiefly on the basal
  two thirds, and crossed by dark-grey wavy lines.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the central band and the basal patch of the fore <!-- Page
  182 --><span class="pagenum" title="264.png"><a
  name="page182"></a>{182}</span>wings are dull reddish-brown, inclining to
  purplish. This form which has been referred to <i>corculata</i>,
  Hufnagel, is pretty generally distributed abroad, but is apparently only
  of local occurrence in the British Isles.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is very similar to that of the next species, it feeds
  on the same kinds of plants, and during the same months of the year.
  (Plate <a href="#plate74">74</a>, Fig. 2.) The first generation of moths
  is on the wing in May and June, and the second in August.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed in England and Wales, often
  plentiful in some districts in the southern half of the former country,
  scarce and more local northwards from Yorkshire. Widely spread in
  Roxburghshire and Clydesdale in Scotland, but less frequent than
  <i>ferrugata</i>; this also seems to be the case in Ireland. The range
  abroad extends to North America.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;It is to be regretted that the
  names by which this and the following species have been known for many
  years may have to be changed. It has been claimed that the reddish-banded
  form of <i>unidentaria</i>, Haworth, is identical with <i>ferrugata</i>
  as figured by Clerck, <i>Icones</i>, Plate XI. Fig. 14, and is also
  referable to <i>corculata</i>, Hufnagel, both earlier names. If the red
  form referred to is adopted as the <i>ferrugata</i> of Clerck, then that
  name will supersede <i>unidentaria</i>, Haworth, and the species now
  known as <i>ferrugata</i>, Clerck, will become <i>spadicearia</i>.
  Authorities, however, are not agreed upon this point, so the question
  still remains open.</p>

<h5><b>Red Twin-spot Carpet</b> (<i>Coremia</i> (<i>Ochyria</i>) <i>ferrugata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Five examples of this variable species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate72">72</a>, Figs. 8-12. The ground colour of the fore wings
  is usually greyish, more or less ochreous tinted, but sometimes inclining
  to whitish; the basal patch and the central band are reddish brown, the
  latter usually entire in southern specimens, but <!-- Page 183 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="265.png"><a
  name="page183"></a>{183}</span>frequently broken up (ab.
  <i>spadicearia</i>, Borkhausen), especially in northern examples. A
  bright, ochreous form, with the central band much streaked, occurring in
  Scotland, has been referred to ab. <i>salicaria</i>, Haworth.
  Occasionally the central band is dark purplish. The hind wings are
  whitish, more or less suffused with smoky grey, and lined with the same;
  the outer margin is bordered with smoky grey.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous brown, mottled with greyish, and marked
  with pale diamonds and black spots on the back of the middle rings; there
  are wavy lines along the sides. It feeds in June and July, and also in
  September and October, on various low plants: knotgrass, dandelion,
  bedstraw, garden marigold, and ground ivy (<i>Nepeta</i>) being
  especially useful in captivity. The moth is usually double-brooded, at
  least in the southern half of England, the first flight occurring in May
  and June, and the second in July and August.</p>

  <p>The species is generally distributed, and often common, over the
  greater part of England and Wales, but somewhat local north of the
  Midlands and through Scotland to Aberdeen; widely spread in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Flame Carpet</b> (<i>Coremia</i> (<i>Ochyria</i>) <i>designata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour of this rather common woodland species (Plate <a
  href="#plate75">75</a>, Figs. 4-6) is pale grey, varying to whitish, or
  sometimes faintly brownish tinged. The purple band on the fore wings is
  always broadly edged in front with black, but the black outer edging is
  irregular, and sometimes only distinct towards the front margin of the
  wings; it varies in width, and in tint, being, in some specimens, faint
  purplish grey.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous, inclining to greyish on the back, which
  is marked with whitish lines on the front rings, and with ochreous
  diamonds and black dots on the other rings; there is also a row of black
  spots low down along the sides; head, <!-- Page 184 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="266.png"><a
  name="page184"></a>{184}</span>brownish, freckled with black. It feeds,
  in June and July, probably, in a wild state, on some kind of "cress,"
  growing in the moister parts of woods; in confinement, it will eat
  cabbage, horseradish, and wallflower, among other kinds of Cruciferæ.
  There is a second brood in August and September. (Plate <a
  href="#plate74">74</a>, Fig. 3, after Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and again in August. It is fond of
  resting on tree-trunks in woods, especially where the ground is moist,
  but it may also be beaten out of hedges and bushes. It is most plentiful
  in the southern half of England, but is spread over the greater part of
  the British Isles, including the Orkneys.</p>

  <p>Abroad, its range extends to Eastern Siberia, Amurland, Japan, and
  North America.</p>

<h5><b>The Beech-Green Carpet</b> (<i>Amoebe olivata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The species, depicted on Plate <a href="#plate75">75</a>, Figs. 9, 10,
  when quite fresh has the fore wings greenish, and the central band more
  or less tinged with brown, in some specimens with blackish; the inner
  edge of the band is not so clearly defined as the outer, the latter being
  followed by a narrow whitish wavy band; a series of black dots edged with
  white represent the submarginal line. Hind wrings, smoky grey, with a
  pale band beyond the middle, and a pale line nearer the outer margin.</p>

  <p>The roughened caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate73">73</a>, Fig. 1) is
  ochreous brown, mottled with darker brown, and lined with grey; the
  raised dots are black, each with a short bristle. It feeds at night on
  bedstraw (<i>Galium</i>), in the spring to May, after hibernation.</p>

  <p>The moth is out, as a rule, in July and August, but sometimes much
  earlier. I reared specimens during the last week in May, 1907, from
  caterpillars sent from Torquay by Mr. Walker. It <!-- Page 185 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="267.png"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span>lurks
  among the vegetation growing on banks, and the hedgerows of lanes,
  etc.</p>

  <p>In the south of England the species chiefly affects the coasts of
  Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall; but it occurs locally in and around beech
  woods of Kent, and is more frequent in those of Berks, Oxford, and Bucks.
  From Somerset it spreads through the western counties, including part of
  Wales, to Lancashire. It is, however, most common among the hills and
  rills from Yorkshire northwards. In Scotland it is local in Roxburgh,
  widely distributed, and sometimes abundant in Clydesdale and throughout
  the Highlands to Sutherland. It has also been noted from Arran. Local in
  Ireland, but apparently abundant in some parts.</p>

<h5><b>Green Carpet</b> (<i>Amoebe viridaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate75">75</a>, Figs. 7, 8), also, has
  green fore wings, with a rather deeper green central band and basal
  patch. The former is limited by white lines marked with black,
  conspicuously so on the front and inner margins; there are also black
  marks on the front edge of the basal patch, and at the tips of the wings.
  The green colour quickly fades to a yellowish or sandy tint.</p>

  <p>The wrinkled caterpillar is olive brown, with bristle-bearing black
  dots; the back has a dark central line, and is adorned with reddish
  V-shaped marks except on the end rings. It feeds in the spring, after
  hibernation, on bedstraw (<i>Galium</i>), but it is said to eat sorrel,
  dead-nettle (<i>Lamium</i>), etc.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June, earlier in the south, and later in the north.
  It hides among herbage during the day, and may occasionally be seen
  resting on tree-trunks, etc., then feeding just before dark about hedges,
  and on commons and heaths. Specimens have been noted in some years in
  September.</p>

  <p>Except that it has not been detected in the Shetlands, the species
  seems to be found in all parts of the British Isles. <!-- Page 186
  --><span class="pagenum" title="268.png"><a
  name="page186"></a>{186}</span></p>

<h5><b>Striped Twin-spot Carpet</b> (<i>Malenydris salicata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Portraits of a male and a female of this species will be found on
  Plate <a href="#plate75">75</a>, Figs. 11 &#x2642; and 12 &#x2640;. The
  fore wings are greyish white, crossed by several darker grey wavy lines;
  the central band is rather darker, and in some specimens there is also a
  darker basal patch. In an almost unicolorous form the fore wings are
  wholly suffused with darker; Kane, who states that such specimens occur
  with the paler form in Ireland, refers the aberration to
  <i>unicolorata</i>, Gregson.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brownish, with three whitish lines along the back,
  and a pinkish line low down along the sides. It feeds, at night, on
  bedstraw (<i>Galium</i>), in September and October, but may be found on
  the plants in the daytime. (Plate <a href="#plate73">73</a>, Fig. 2,
  after Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and in some localities again in
  August and September. It is fond of sitting on rocks, and also on
  tree-trunks.</p>

  <p>Except that it has been found, not infrequently, on Dartmoor and
  Exmoor, in Devon, and has also been once noted from Dorset, the species
  in England is chiefly an inhabitant of the northern counties. It occurs
  in Wales, but almost exclusively in the north. In Scotland it appears to
  be widely distributed throughout; and in Ireland it occurs locally in all
  four provinces.</p>

<h5><b>Mottled Grey</b> (<i>Malenydris multistrigaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings in the typical form of this species are grey, with a
  slight brownish tinge; basal patch, central band, and shade before the
  whitish submarginal line, sometimes darker. (Plate <a
  href="#plate77">77</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;.) In some specimens
  the central band is very much darker (ab. <i>virgata</i>, Tutt); and in
  some parts of <!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum" title="269.png"><a
  name="page187"></a>{187}</span>south-west Yorkshire a blackish form (ab.
  <i>nubilata</i>, Tutt) is not uncommon. (Plate <a href="#plate77">77</a>,
  Fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous grey, with three brownish lines along the
  back, and two other lines on each side, the upper one yellowish, wavy,
  and edged above with dusky. It feeds on bedstraw (<i>Galium</i>) in May
  and June. (Plate <a href="#plate73">73</a>, Fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in March and April, and keeps pretty much to the
  shelter afforded by its food plant or other herbage around in its
  favourite haunts, which are damp woodlands, heaths, and mosses.
  Occasionally, however, it may be seen on the lower parts of fences,
  tree-trunks, rocks, etc. About dusk it may be found sitting on grass and
  other vegetation, and at such times is not much disposed to fly away from
  the collector.</p>

  <p>Pretty generally distributed throughout the British Isles, including
  the Orkneys.</p>

<h5><b>Twin-spot Carpet</b> (<i>Malenydris didymata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings in the male are pale greyish, more or less tinged with
  ochreous brown, and crossed by a dark grey, inclining to blackish,
  central band; the base of the wings is often banded with dark grey, as
  also is the outer marginal area; on the latter, above the middle, are
  twin black spots, and there is a black spot or streak above nearer the
  tip of the wing. The female is smaller, paler, often whitish, and
  sometimes pale ochreous; the latter form is prevalent in the Shetlands;
  the central band is the only distinct cross marking in this sex. On the
  moorlands in the north of England a blackish form of the male occurs (ab.
  <i>nigra</i>, Prout), and this is very similar to ab. <i>nubilata</i> of
  the previous species; ab. <i>ochroleucata</i>, Aurivillius, is uniformly
  greyish brown, with a white submarginal line, and I have a specimen near
  this from Durham.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, inclining to yellowish on the back, <!--
  Page 188 --><span class="pagenum" title="270.png"><a
  name="page188"></a>{188}</span>and to pinkish on the sides; three lines
  along the side, the central one dark green, and the others whitish. It
  feeds on primrose, red campion (<i>Lychnis diurna</i>), bilberry, etc.,
  as well as on the flowers of coarse grasses; in North Devon I found it in
  profusion at night, on the blossoms of a wood-rush (<i>Luzula</i>),
  growing in a sheltered wood near the sea. April and May, later perhaps in
  the north. (Plate <a href="#plate77">77</a>, Figs. 4-6 &#x2642;, 7-9
  &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, and is common in almost every part
  of the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>November Moth</b> (<i>Oporabia</i> (<i>Epirrita</i>) <i>dilutata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The more usual forms of this common autumnal species are those
  represented by Figs. 1 and 2, Plate <a href="#plate78">78</a>. Fig. 3 is
  a small example of the pale form, ab. <i>christyi</i>, Prout, which, in
  many respects, is very similar to <i>autumnata</i>, Guenée, a form of the
  next species. Fig. 4 is a female approaching ab. <i>obscurata</i>,
  Staud., and Fig. 5 shows the uniformly blackish ab. <i>melana</i>, Prout.
  In some pale-coloured specimens the only conspicuous marking is a broad
  central band which is almost black in colour (ab. <i>latifasciata</i>,
  Prout).</p>

  <p>The eggs (Plate <a href="#plate76">76</a>, Fig. 1<i>a</i>) were
  yellowish when laid, but soon changed to crimson red.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, inclining to whitish below, often marked,
  more or less distinctly, with purplish red, as a central line, or series
  of spots, along the back, and sometimes as bands on the ring division. It
  feeds on the foliage of trees, such as elm, oak, birch, etc., also on
  fallow, hawthorn, sloe, apple, plum, and other fruit trees. April to
  June. (Plate <a href="#plate76">76</a>, Fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in October and November in the South, but earlier in
  the North. It is an inhabitant of woodlands, and may be disturbed from
  bushes, trees, and sometimes may be seen on the trunks of the latter, and
  on fences. At night it flies lazily and will occasionally visit ivy then,
  and even sugar, but is more frequently attracted by light.</p>

  <p>The species is pretty generally common throughout England and Wales,
  Scotland up to Moray, and Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Autumnal Moth</b> (<i>Oporabia</i> (<i>Epirrita</i>) <i>autumnata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Three examples of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate78">78</a>. Figs. 6 &#x2642; and 7 &#x2640; represent the
  typical form except that the male should be rather more silvery white in
  the ground colour of the fore wings, and the cross bands more distinctly
  separated. Fig. 8, also a female, is very close to ab. <i>sandbergi</i>,
  Lampa, in the character of the central cross bands of the fore wings. Ab.
  <i>gueneata</i>, Prout (<i>autumnata</i>, Guenée, not Borkhausen), is a
  form with the typical coloration, but with fainter cross bands.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is somewhat similar to that of the last species, but
  there is a yellowish tint in the general green coloration, and it is
  rarely marked with reddish. It is found chiefly on birch, alder, fir, and
  larch, but will eat hawthorn, and probably the foliage of other shrubs
  and trees. May and June.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in September and October, sometimes later. It may be
  dislodged from trees in the daytime, but it seems to be rarely noticed at
  rest on the trunks.</p>

  <p>The species is so often confused with that previously mentioned that
  its distribution in our islands has not, so far, been clearly
  ascertained. However, it certainly occurs in the following northern
  counties of England&mdash;Lancashire (Liverpool district); Cheshire
  (Delamere Forest); Yorkshire (Cleveland district); North Durham (Birch
  woods); Cumberland (Carlisle). In Scotland it is found in Clydesdale,
  Perthshire, where it was first noted by Weaver in 1851, Kincardineshire,
  Aberdeen, and probably further north; in Ireland at Belfast and
  Enniskillen. Prout notes that he has seen a specimen from Swansea in
  South Wales. <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum" title="274.png"><a
  name="page190"></a>{190}</span></p>

<h5><b>Small Autumnal Carpet</b> (<i>Oporabia</i> (<i>Epirrita</i>) <i>filigrammaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is most probably a small moorland form of <i>O. autumnata</i>,
  but it rarely assumes the silvery white typical coloration of that
  species. A male specimen and two examples of the female are depicted on
  Plate <a href="#plate77">77</a>, Figs. 10 &#x2642;, 11, and 12
  &#x2640;.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds in the spring on bilberry and heather, is
  green, with yellow lines, a line of darker green between the two central
  yellow lines along the back; head, green, inclining to brown above.</p>

  <p>The moth appears in August and early September, and may be found on
  the moors, resting on rocks, stones, and even on the ground, as well as
  on the stems of its food plants.</p>

  <p>As a British species it was first recorded by Weaver, who obtained it
  in the Isle of Arran in 1841; but Edleston, writing in 1842, states that
  he had taken specimens off stone walls near Staley Bridge, in the
  Manchester district, "every year for the last three years." It appears to
  be peculiar to the British Isles and is found in suitable localities from
  North Staffs., through Cheshire, Lancs., Yorks., and northwards over
  England and Scotland to the Hebrides and the Orkneys. In Ireland it is
  known to occur in Antrim, Derry, Mayo, Galway, and Limerick.</p>

<h5><b>The Welsh Wave</b> (<i>Venusia cambrica</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth, of which two portraits are given on Plate <a
  href="#plate78">78</a>, Figs. 9 &#x2642;, 10 &#x2640;, is known also by
  the English name of "Cambric Wave." It was not ascertained to be an
  inhabitant of Britain until 1839, when it was figured and described by
  Curtis from specimens obtained in Cardiganshire in Wales. <!-- Page 191
  --><span class="pagenum" title="275.png"><a
  name="page191"></a>{191}</span></p>

  <p>In its typical form the fore wings are white, inclining to greyish,
  with a number of brownish or dark-grey cross lines; two pairs on the
  central area are marked with black. Sometimes the wings are greatly
  suffused with smoky grey, and this tint in examples from the Sheffield
  and Rotherham districts of Yorkshire assumes a much darker hue, so that
  all the markings are obscured, but the veins are blacker.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, marked with some irregular reddish blotches;
  a yellowish line along the back. It feeds in August, earlier or later in
  some seasons, on mountain ash (<i>Pyrus aucuparia</i>), and the moth,
  which rests by day on tree-trunks, is out in July and early August. The
  haunts of the species are chiefly in hilly localities of the northern
  counties of England, but it has also been reported from Gloucestershire
  (Cotswolds), Somersetshire (Weston-super-Mare), and Devon (Dulverton). In
  Wales it occurs in Merionethshire, as well as in Cardiganshire; and in
  Scotland it spreads from Roxburghshire, where it is locally common among
  mountain ash, through Clydesdale to Inverness. It is widely distributed
  in Ireland. The range abroad extends to Japan and North America.</p>

<h5><b>Grey Mountain Carpet</b> (<i>Entephria cæsiata</i>)</h5>

  <p>The typical greyish form, with blackish wavy cross lines and dark
  central band, is shown on Plate <a href="#plate80">80</a>, Fig. 1
  &#x2642; and 2 &#x2640;. Figure 3 represents a specimen from Shetland in
  which the band is sooty black (ab. <i>annosata</i>, Zetterstedt =
  <i>nigristriaria</i>, Gregson). The interesting blackish suffused form
  from the Isle of Arran (Fig. 4) leads up to a still blacker variety,
  occurring in the same isle, and also in the Shetlands, in which the whole
  of the fore wings is nearly as dark as the central band of Fig. 3, and
  the hind wings are also much darkened; such specimens are referable to
  ab. <i>glaciata</i>, Germar. Ab. <i>prospicuata</i>, Prout =
  <i>gelata</i>, Staud., is a form with the fore wings whitish, and the
  <!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum" title="276.png"><a
  name="page192"></a>{192}</span>base and the central band thereof
  blackish; some Shetland specimens closely approach this pretty
  variety.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with a brownish line along the middle of the
  back, and a series of pinkish or purplish-red oblique streaks which
  nearly meet at the central line and so form V-shaped marks; a whitish or
  yellowish stripe low down along the sides, sometimes edged above with
  reddish. In some examples the general colour is reddish brown. It feeds
  in April and May, after hibernation, on bilberry, ling, and heath in a
  wild state, but may be reared on knot-grass or sallow.</p>

  <p>The moth is out from June until early August, and may be found
  resting, often in numbers, on rocks and stone walls in mountain and
  moorland districts, from Herefordshire, northwards through England, North
  Wales, and over the whole of Scotland, including the isles, and Ireland.
  Kane states that in the latter country melanic forms, such as those from
  Yorks, etc., are nowhere met with.</p>

<h5><b>Yellow-ringed Carpet</b> (<i>Entephria flavicinctata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The general colour of the fore wings of British specimens of this
  species (var. <i>obscurata</i>, Staud.) is slaty grey; the basal,
  central, and outer marginal cross bands are thickly sprinkled with
  yellowish-brown, and it is this feature that at once separates this
  species (Plate <a href="#plate80">80</a>, Figs. 5, 6) from that last
  referred to.</p>

  <p>The bristly caterpillar is green, chocolate, or red brown, but always
  of a dull shade; on the back is a series of black V-shaped marks, and a
  central dark, slender line; the front part of each V-mark filled up with
  pink or lilac, forming a triangle, the apex of which is yellow; a
  yellowish stripe low down along the side (adapted from Fenn). It feeds in
  the spring till April, after hibernation, on saxifrage (<i>Saxifraga
  aizoides</i>, <i>S. hypnoides</i>, etc), and also on stonecrop
  (<i>Sedum</i>), and is most partial to the flowers of these plants.</p>

  <p>The moth flies throughout the summer, possibly in two generations, as,
  when reared in confinement, moths appear in May, and from eggs obtained
  from these, caterpillars feed in June and July, and attain the perfect
  state in August. Like the last species, its chief resting-places are the
  rocks, in its favourite haunts, in gorges among the hills and moorlands.
  It has been recorded from few parts of northern England, but one specimen
  is said to have been taken in Dovedale, Derbyshire. In Lancashire it has
  been noted as scarce about Clougha; and in Yorkshire one example was
  taken on Malham Moor in August, 1876, and one at Hutton Buscel Moor, near
  Scarborough, July 16, 1891. It is more plentiful in Scotland; in
  Clydesdale it is local, but not uncommon, the localities mentioned being
  Lochgoilhead, and watercourses above Ardentinny; more frequent in
  Perthshire, thence to Sutherland, and it occurs also in the Hebrides and
  the Orkneys. In Ireland, it is found in Co. Antrim; and Mr. Thomas Greer
  informs me that it is common at Murlough Bay, Fair Head.</p>

<h5><b>Silver-ground Carpet</b> (<i>Xanthorhoë montanata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Figs. 7 and 8 on Plate <a href="#plate80">80</a> represent the most
  usual form of this species, which is variable in the amount of clouding
  on the fore wings and in the intensity of the cross marking. In some
  specimens, chiefly from southern localities, the fore wings are almost
  clear white, and the central band is broadly blackish (Fig. 9). Shetland
  specimens, on the other hand, are much clouded or suffused with ochreous
  brown, and the central band is greyish brown (ab. <i>shetlandica</i>,
  Weir (Fig. 10)). Then there is variation in the central band, which is
  often entire, but more frequently broken up by bandlets; or it may be
  considerably narrowed, especially from the middle to the inner margin,
  and not altogether rarely it is completely severed below the middle, and
  the lower part almost or quite absent. A specimen with all <!-- Page 194
  --><span class="pagenum" title="280.png"><a
  name="page194"></a>{194}</span>the wings smoky leaden-grey, and the
  central bar of the fore wings pale grey-brown, was taken near Longfleet
  in Wiltshire, in the summer of 1881.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is wrinkled, with a ridge along the sides; in colour
  it is pale brown, inclining to purplish with blackish dots; three lines
  along the back, the central one dark greyish, the others paler and
  broader; below the latter the sides are greyish tinted with a lower
  edging of pale yellowish brown. It feeds at night on bedstraw, and
  various low-growing herbage, including grass. August to April.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, sometimes earlier in the south. It
  is generally distributed, and, as a rule, common, in woodlands, lanes,
  etc., throughout the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>Garden Carpet</b> (<i>Xanthorhoë fluctuata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Of this common frequenter of our gardens four examples are depicted on
  Plate <a href="#plate80">80</a>. Figs. 11 and 13 are the more frequent
  forms, but specimens with the central band complete, as in Fig. 12, are
  not uncommon. Chiefly, but by no means exclusively, in Southern
  localities, some examples have the ground colour almost pure white; often
  the wings are more or less suffused with dark grey (ab.
  <i>neapolisata</i>, Millière), and this is especially the case in
  Scotland, where, in Aberdeenshire and in Shetland, a blackish form, ab.
  <i>thules</i>, Prout, occurs. Fig. 14 represents a specimen of this form
  from Aberdeen. Somewhat rarely, the central band is only indicated by a
  small spot on the front area of the wing (ab. <i>costovata</i>, Haworth),
  and more often the band is much narrowed or otherwise modified in the
  direction of that aberration. Fig. 4, Plate <a href="#plate61">61</a>,
  shows an extreme example of this form. Specimens vary in size from rather
  under one inch to one inch and a half in expanse.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar varies in colour from dark grey through yellowish
  green to obscure green, but the underside is always paler; on the back
  there is a series of pale blotches, and some black spots on the middle
  rings; the head is rather paler than the general colour, and marked with
  black. It feeds, at night, on cabbage, horseradish, wallflower, white
  arabis, and many other kinds of Cruciferæ; and it is said to eat the
  foliage of gooseberry and currant. June&mdash;October.</p>

  <p>There are certainly two broods, and possibly more, as the moths occur
  in greater or lesser numbers throughout the year, from late April to
  October, but it seems to be most plentiful in May and June, and in August
  and September.</p>

  <p>Generally distributed over the British Isles. It is also an inhabitant
  of North America.</p>

<h5><b>The Galium Carpet</b> (<i>Xanthorhoë galiata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The more usual forms of this species are represented on Plate <a
  href="#plate81">81</a>, Figs. 1, 2. Fig. 3 is the portrait of a form
  occurring in Yorkshire, Sussex, and probably elsewhere, in which the
  central band is blackish and solid-looking; this seems to be referable to
  <i>unilobata</i>, Haworth. Besides varying in tint of ground colour, and
  in the amount of freckling or mottling, there is modification in the
  width of the central band.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brown, dotted with black, and striped with blackish
  brown on the back, and with pale brown on the sides; the head is light
  brown, sprinkled with black, and marked with <!-- Page 196 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="284.png"><a name="page196"></a>{196}</span>a dark
  V. It feeds on bedstraw in late June and July, and there is a second
  brood in August and September. The figure of the caterpillar on Plate <a
  href="#plate79">79</a>, Fig. 3, is from a coloured drawing by Mr. A.
  Sich.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June, sometimes later in the north and earlier in
  the south, where it occurs as a second generation in August. It is
  chiefly found in chalk and limestone districts, and may be easily put up
  from the herbage among which it secretes itself during the day. In the
  seaboard counties of England, from Kent to Cornwall, it is especially
  common on the coast, but is also to be met with in suitable inland
  localities in these counties, and also in Surrey, Middlesex, Herts,
  Bucks., and Oxford. It is always rare on the eastern side, but on the
  west, including Wales, it is more or less frequent from Somerset and
  Wilts. to Westmorland. Not uncommon in Yorkshire, principally in the West
  Riding, and an odd specimen has been recorded from Durham. Somewhat rare
  in Scotland, but it has been noted in Berwick, Wigtown, Arran,
  Clydesdale, and Perthshire. In Ireland it is local, although often
  plentiful on the coast.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Eastern Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>Wood Carpet</b> (<i>Xanthorhoë (Epirrhoë) rivata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The broad, clear white borders of both edges of the dark central band
  of the fore wings, coupled with the clearer white of the hind wings, and
  the generally larger size of the moth, should distinguish this species
  from its very close ally, <i>X. sociata</i>; but it must be added that
  some forms of the latter species approach the present one exceedingly
  close. (Plate <a href="#plate81">81</a>, Figs. 4, 5.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brown or olive-brown, dotted and freckled with
  white; three lines on the back, the central one black, the others
  whitish, not seen on rings 5-8, which have dark V-shaped marks enclosing
  white ones; sometimes there is a V-mark instead of lines on ring 4; head,
  large, pale brown sprinkled with blackish, and marked with a blackish V,
  the apex of which appears to meet the central line of the body. It feeds,
  at night, in July and August, on bedstraw (<i>Galium mollugo</i>, and
  <i>G. verum</i>), but will thrive very well on cleavers or goose-grass
  (<i>G. aparine</i>). The chrysalis, which is enclosed in a cocoon of silk
  coated with earth, is reddish brown, thorax and wing-cases paler,
  shining. A coloured drawing of the caterpillar, kindly lent, with others,
  for this volume, by Mr. A. Sich, has been used for the figures on Plate
  <a href="#plate79">79</a>, Figs. 2, 2<i>a</i>; but the description of the
  caterpillar, and also of the chrysalis (Fig. 2<i>b</i>), are from
  material that Mr. Pope, of Exeter, was good enough to furnish. In
  captivity a second brood may be reared in August.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and early August, and although local, is not
  uncommon in bushy places on downs, etc., also in lanes, in chalk
  districts, in most of the southern and eastern counties. In the north of
  England it is far more local and uncommon, but is known to occur in
  Cheshire, Yorkshire, and Cumberland, and has been recorded from Durham.
  It is found in Wales, and in Scotland has been noted as very local in
  Roxburghshire and rare in Clydesdale and Arran. Kane states that in
  Ireland it is "very rare and local."</p>

<h5><b>Common Carpet</b> (<i>Xanthorhoë</i> (<i>Epirrhoë</i>) <i>sociata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The white ground colour of this species is nearly always obscured, to
  a greater or lesser extent, by greyish markings and suffusions on the
  basal area; the outer margin is broadly bordered with dark grey, and the
  white band between this and the dark-grey central band is intersected
  throughout its length by a grey line. As shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate81">81</a>, Figs. 6, 7, the central band varies in width; it
  is often contracted below the middle, sometimes completely severed at
  this point, and in ab. <i>degenerata</i>, <!-- Page 198 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="288.png"><a
  name="page198"></a>{198}</span>Haworth, both portions are much reduced in
  width. Figs. 8 and 9 represent two specimens from the Isle of Lewis;
  these brownish-grey examples are var. <i>obscurata</i>, South. There are
  intermediate modifications leading up to a form in which the whole of the
  central third of the fore wings is whitish, with the usual cross lines
  dingy grey, and some tiny clouds of the same colour around the black
  discal spot.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is very like that of the last species referred to, but
  it is rather smaller in size and rougher in appearance. There is
  variation in the general colour, from pale fawn through greenish-brown,
  to dull or bright green, and sometimes the markings are tinged with
  reddish (Hellins).</p>

  <p>It feeds on bedstraw, in June and July, and a second brood occurs in
  September. The figure of the brownish, inclining to reddish, chrysalis
  (Plate <a href="#plate79">79</a>, Fig. 4), is from a photo by Mr. H.
  Main, and is twice the natural size.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and, in the South especially, again
  in August and September. It is generally distributed over the British
  Islands, but so far has not been noted from the Shetlands.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Eastern Siberia and Amurland.</p>

  <p>According to Prout, the earliest name for this species is
  <i>alternata</i> (Müller).</p>

<h5><b>Small Argent and Sable</b> (<i>Xanthorhoë</i> (<i>Epirrhoë</i>) <i>tristata</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate81">81</a> are shown three examples of this
  variable species. Fig. 10 represents the typical form from N. Devon. Fig.
  11 is a black-marked specimen from Yorkshire, and Fig. 12 depicts a
  smoky-brown marked specimen from Clydesdale, in which the ground colour
  has a brownish tinge. All these have the central band more or less
  entire, but this character may be broader or narrower, and is sometimes
  divided into two parts, and these reduced to very small proportions; the
  white projections into <!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum" title="289.png"
  ><a name="page199"></a>{199}</span>the outer marginal border of all the
  wings is not infrequently enlarged, in some cases so much so that the
  borders are separated into two parts, and also reduced in width.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is grey brown, ochreous brown between the rings and on
  the underside; a dark line along the back, and a dark-edged, pale line on
  each side; a black dot on each ring at the junction of the dark upper and
  pale lower areas; head, grey-brown, with blackish freckles. It feeds, in
  July and August, on bedstraw, preferring the heath kind (<i>Galium
  saxatile</i>), but will eat the large hedge kind (<i>G. mollugo</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June, or from late May, and in some parts specimens
  are seen in August. Its haunts are moors and upland heaths, and its
  British distribution extends from Dartmoor and Exmoor, in Devon, through
  Western England and Wales to Westmorland. It appears to be very local in
  Somerset, Gloucester, Hereford, Shropshire, and Cheshire; from
  Staffordshire and Derbyshire northwards, and through Scotland, it becomes
  more plentiful; and has been recorded from the Shetlands. In Ireland it
  is local, but common where it occurs.</p>

<h5><b>Sharp-angled Carpet</b> (<i>Xanthorhoë</i> (<i>Euphyia</i>) <i>unangulata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate82">82</a>, Figs. 1, 2) may be
  recognized by the distinctly angled outer edge of the blackish central
  band, which is thrown into strong relief by the usually broad white
  stripe following it. Wilkes, who figured the moth in 1742, called it the
  "White Stripe." By some authors the species is referred to
  <i>amniculata</i>, Hübner.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale whity brown, with a slightly darker but
  indistinct line along the centre of the back, and a black spot on the
  middle rings; a pale line on the sides is edged with dark grey; head,
  brown, marked with black. It feeds, in July and early August, on
  chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth, which is partial to hedges and easily disturbed <!-- Page
  200 --><span class="pagenum" title="290.png"><a
  name="page200"></a>{200}</span>therefrom, is out in June and July, and
  even later in some seasons. The earliest hatched caterpillars reared in
  confinement sometimes attain the moth state in August of the same year.
  Although certainly local, the species has a wide distribution in the
  southern half of England, and is not uncommon in some localities. Its
  range extends into Wales, and also northwards to Cumberland and
  Westmorland, but it is generally very much scarcer in the north than in
  the south. In Ireland it is known to occur locally in counties Antrim,
  Tyrone, Fermanagh, Waterford, Kerry, and Galway, but, as a rule, only
  sparingly.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the distribution includes North Amurland and North
  America.</p>

<h5><b>Cloaked Carpet</b> (<i>Euphyia picata</i>).</h5>

  <p>An older English name for this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate82">82</a>, Figs. 4, 5) is "The Short Cloak Carpet," Harris
  (1782), but that given to it by Haworth is here adopted. It is also the
  <i>biangulata</i> of Haworth, Stephens, and others.</p>

  <p>As will be observed on referring to the figures, the outer edge of the
  blackish central band of the fore wings is twice angled just above the
  middle; the basal area and the outer marginal border are dark greyish
  brown, more or less tinged with olive; the whitish ground colour only
  shows distinctly as a strip immediately beyond the central band, and from
  this an irregular streak runs to the tips of the wings; some white wavy
  cross-lines through the outer border are often obscure.</p>

  <p>The stoutish caterpillar is yellowish brown, or sometimes reddish
  brown; there is a series of blackish or dark-brown spots along the back,
  and a stripe of dusky freckles along each side; lower down are two
  slender wavy lines enclosing a dusky stripe; head, yellowish-brown
  mottled with darker brown. It feeds, at night, on chickweed and other
  kinds of <i>Stellaria</i>, in <!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum" title="291.png"
  ><a name="page201"></a>{201}</span>August and September. One of the
  mouse-ear chickweeds (<i>Cerastium glomeratum</i>) has also been
  mentioned as a food plant, and for rearing the caterpillars this would
  perhaps be useful, as common chickweed, unless in a growing state, is
  difficult to keep in a suitable condition for larval requirements.</p>

  <p>The moth, which is partial to a hedgerow as a hiding-place, is out in
  June and July, and may be sometimes reared as a second generation in
  September.</p>

  <p>The species is somewhat local, but it is not scarce in many parts of
  England; its range does not appear to extend northwards beyond
  Worcestershire on the western side, although it has been recorded from
  North Wales; on the eastern side it is found up to Norfolk.</p>

<h5><b>The Argent and Sable</b> (<i>Eulype hastata</i>).</h5>

  <p>About one hundred and sixty years ago Wilkes figured this species as
  "The Mottled Beauty," but Harris in 1778 gave it its present English
  name. On Plate <a href="#plate82">82</a> are shown two examples of the
  typical form (Figs. 7, 8), also two specimens of the small form (Figs.
  10, 11), var. <i>subhastata</i>, Nolcken (= <i>hastulata</i>, Hübner);
  the latter form in Britain occurs chiefly in Sutherlandshire and the Isle
  of Lewis. As regards variation there is, in the small form, a tendency to
  an increase of black; whilst in the typical form there is a considerable
  reduction of the black marking&mdash;so much so occasionally that of the
  central black band only a few dots remain around the discal spot, and
  perhaps a speck or two below it, and a dot or two on the inner margin
  (ab. <i>demolita</i>, Prout).</p>

  <p>The rather stumpy caterpillar is dark olive-green, inclining to
  blackish, and somewhat shiny; the skin along the sides puckered and
  marked with ochreous; a black line along the middle of the back; head,
  black and glossy. It feeds, in July and August, later in the north, on
  birch, <i>Vaccinium</i>, chiefly <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum" title="292.png"
  ><a name="page202"></a>{202}</span><i>uliginosum</i>, and sweet gale
  (<i>Myrica</i>). It spins together the leaves at the tips of the twigs,
  and so forms a cocoon-like habitation. The moth is out in May and June,
  and even July in the north. It flies in the afternoon sunshine around and
  over birch trees, and occasionally alights on the leaves. It has been
  taken in Kent, and more frequently in Essex and Suffolk, but it is more
  plentiful in Oxfordshire and Berkshire, and from Surrey to Dorsetshire
  and Wiltshire; also in Herefordshire and Worcestershire, and on high
  ground in North Wales, Staffordshire, and Derbyshire; its range extending
  through Cheshire and Lancashire to Cumberland and Northumberland, but
  only odd specimens have been reported from the last-named county and from
  Durham. The egg and the caterpillar are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate79">79</a>, Figs. 1 and 1<i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>It is widely distributed, and often common in places, throughout
  Scotland. In Ireland it is local, but has occurred plentifully in some of
  its haunts in that country; Kane states that var. <i>subhastata</i> has
  not been noted.</p>

  <p>The range abroad spreads to Amurland, China, Iceland, Labrador, and
  North America.</p>

<h5><b>Beautiful Carpet</b> (<i>Mesoleuca albicillata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The English name of this species (Plate <a href="#plate82">82</a>,
  Fig. 13) is exceedingly appropriate; few of our native moths exhibit such
  a pleasing combination of colour and marking. It varies but very little
  in a general way, but a specimen taken in York some years ago has the
  fore wings dark leaden grey instead of creamy white (ab. <i>suffusa</i>,
  Carrington), and very rarely the ground colour inclines to yellow.</p>

  <p>The stoutish caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate76">76</a>, Fig. 2) is
  green with reddish marks along the back; a white line low down along the
  sides is edged below with purplish red on the first three rings; the last
  ring, and the claspers, tinged with purplish red. It feeds <!-- Page 203
  --><span class="pagenum" title="293.png"><a
  name="page203"></a>{203}</span>at night on bramble and raspberry, in
  August and September, occasionally earlier or later. In the daytime it
  rests on the underside of a leaf. When full grown it forms a cocoon just
  under the surface of the soil, or among rubbish (in the cage), and
  therein changes to a dark reddish-brown chrysalis (Plate <a
  href="#plate76">76</a>, Fig. 2<i>a</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June, sometimes in late May, and occasionally there
  seems to be a few individuals about in August. The species is a denizen
  of the woodlands, and is generally to be found in the more open parts of
  woods where its food plants are well established. It is widely
  distributed over England and Wales, but most frequent in the south of the
  former country. In Scotland, it is local in Roxburghshire and
  Wigtownshire; and it occurs in many parts of Ireland. The range abroad
  extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Purple Bar</b> (<i>Mesoleuca ocellata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The whitish fore wings of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate82">82</a>, Fig. 12) are often tinged with pale ochreous
  brown on the lower two-thirds of the outer marginal area, and this tint
  sometimes invades the central portion of the bluish-black central band.
  Rarely the ground colour is almost entirely white, and the central band
  is very slender (ab. <i>coarctata</i>, Prout), and perhaps rather more
  frequently the band is completely severed below the middle.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds at night on bedstraw (<i>Galium
  mollugo</i> and <i>G. verum</i>), is pale ochreous brown, or pale pinkish
  brown, netted with darker brown; on the back are a reddish ochreous
  central line, and some reddish edged pale V-marks: June and July, and
  sometimes again in the autumn.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and early July, occasionally in late May in
  some southern localities. Individuals of a second emergence sometimes
  appear in August and September. It <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum" title="294.png"
  ><a name="page204"></a>{204}</span>rests by day on tree-trunks or in
  hedges, and flies at night. Widely distributed over the British Isles,
  but, except perhaps in the highlands of Scotland, not very common.</p>

<h5><b>Blue-bordered Carpet</b> (<i>Mesoleuca bicolorata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The more usual form of this pretty little species is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate82">82</a>, Figs. 3 and 6. In the type the central band is
  only represented by a spot on the front margin of the fore wings; in
  ab.<i>parvula</i>, Retz = <i>rubiginata</i>, Hübner, there is also a
  portion of the band showing on the inner margin. Ab. <i>plumbata</i>,
  Curtis, from Scotland has the central band entire and the ground colour
  inclining to creamy white. In ab. <i>fumosa</i>, Prout, the usual white
  parts of the wing are smoky or dark lead colour (Fig. 9). Barrett
  mentions a form with all the wings smoothly smoky black; markings of the
  fore wings olive brown, margined with slender stripes of smoky white.</p>

  <p>The long, thin, caterpillar is green, with a darker stripe along the
  back, and a yellowish green stripe on each side; two points on the last
  ring. It feeds on alder, birch, sloe, and crab; also in orchards and
  gardens on plum and apple: April to June.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August. It appears to occur most freely in
  districts where alder is plentiful, but it is not uncommon in country
  lanes, especially where these are rather moist. It is one of the earliest
  Geometrid moths to get on the wing, as it is generally active well before
  dark. Decidedly more common in some districts than in others, but it may
  be said to be generally distributed.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Eastern Siberia, Amurland, and Japan, but
  the ab.<i>fumosa</i> is only known from Britain.</p>

<h5><b>Pretty Chalk Carpet</b> (<i>Melanthia procellata</i>).</h5>

  <p>From almost any well-grown hedgerow, in which traveller's joy, or
  old-man's beard (<i>Clematis vitalba</i>) is plentiful, throughout the
  southern counties of England, this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate82">82</a>, Fig. 14) may be disturbed by the beating stick.
  It is generally to be met with in July and early August, but may be
  obtained in forward seasons, or in sheltered localities, at the end of
  June.</p>

  <p>On the fore wings the dark, slender and wavy cross lines are more
  distinct in some specimens than in others, and occasionally the blackish
  blotch on the front margin is traversed by a white line, sometimes by two
  lines.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale ochreous brown, with three darker brown lines
  along the back, the central one slender, spotted with black on the middle
  rings; usual dots, black, encircled with white; head, marked with a
  reddish brown triangle. It feeds on <i>Clematis</i> in August and
  September.</p>

  <p>Distribution of the species abroad extends to Amurland, and in Japan,
  Corea, and China it is represented by the darker <i>inquinata</i>,
  Butler.</p>

<h5><b>The Rivulet</b> (<i>Perizoma affinitata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The whitish band crossing the brownish fore wings is generally fairly
  wide, sometimes broad, but occasionally it is very narrow; the reduction
  in width is mainly the result of brownish suffusion of the outer half of
  the band, leaving the inner half white. Kane mentions a smoky form from
  Co. Derry, in which the band is absent, and refers this to ab.
  <i>unicolorata</i>, Gregson. In a specimen from Sligo in my series, the
  band is tinged with brownish throughout. The hind wings are usually smoky
  brown, with a paler central band, but in some specimens, referable to ab.
  <i>turbaria</i>, Stephens, the basal two-thirds are whitish. The moths
  also vary in size (Plate <a href="#plate83">83</a>, Figs. 1 and 2).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pinkish-ochreous inclining to brown; three pinkish
  lines along the back, and a similar line along the blackish spiracles; a
  dark plate on the first and last rings. It feeds in the capsules, on the
  seeds, of red campion (<i>Lychnis</i> <!-- Page 206 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="298.png"><a
  name="page206"></a>{206}</span><i>dioica</i>), and will eat those of the
  white <i>L. vespertina</i>: July to September. When eggs can be obtained
  early, it is possible to rear moths from them in August of the same
  year.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, in some southern districts in late
  May.</p>

  <p>As it conceals itself during the day among its food plant, or other
  vegetation around, it may be put up therefrom by gently stirring the
  herbage; but it flies freely about sundown, and is then easily
  netted.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed over England, Wales, and Scotland,
  up to Moray. In Ireland it is local and not plentiful, and the same is
  the case in the North of England.</p>

<h5><b>Small Rivulet</b> (<i>Perizoma alchemillata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate83">83</a>, Figs. 3 and 6) is
  exceedingly close to the last mentioned, but in a general way it is to be
  distinguished by its greyish-brown coloration. A stippled whitish stripe
  before the central band, usually only faintly indicated in
  <i>affinitata</i>, is fairly distinct as a rule. Although the outer edge
  of the central band is rather more irregular, the middle tooth is not so
  prominent as in <i>affinitata</i>.</p>

  <p>The rather plump caterpillar is purplish above and yellowish green
  below; three yellow lines on the back, the central one broad; the
  spiracles are black, and a little above them is another yellow line;
  head, black and glossy, and there are black shining plates on the first
  and last rings of the body, that on the first ring divided by the yellow
  central line (adapted from Porritt). It feeds, in August and September,
  in the seed capsules of hemp nettle (<i>Galeopsis tetrahit</i>),
  sometimes on the rarer <i>G. ladanum</i>, and is said to eat woundwort
  (<i>Stachys</i>) occasionally.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, and, as in the case of the last
  species, may be stirred up from among its food plant or the surrounding
  vegetation, in lanes, and around wood borders. The species is widely
  distributed over the British Isles, except that it seems not to have been
  noticed in Scotland, north of Moray, although it occurs in the
  Hebrides.</p>

<h5><b>Sandy Carpet</b> (<i>Perizoma flavofasciata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The pale ochreous-brown, or sandy, markings on the white fore wings of
  this species readily distinguish it from either of its allies. Variable
  in size, and also in the brownish tint of the markings; the central band
  is usually contracted below the middle, and not infrequently it is
  completely severed at this point. It is the <i>decolorata</i> of Hübner,
  and although more generally known by that name, the earlier
  <i>flavofasciata</i>, Thunberg, will have to be adopted for this species.
  (Plate <a href="#plate85">85</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The stoutish caterpillar is pale reddish ochreous with browner lines;
  head, brown and shining, plate on first and last rings of the body brown.
  It feeds on the flower buds, and on the immature seeds, of the red
  campion (<i>Lychnis dioica</i>), and the white campion (<i>L.
  vespertina</i>), but is more partial to the first named; in Ireland it is
  said to feed on bladder campion (<i>Silene inflata</i>).</p>

  <p>In July and August, or even later, the moth may be beaten out of
  hedgerows, sandy banks, and borders of woods, and sometimes disturbed
  from patches of the campion growing in thickets; in such places it is on
  the wing about sundown.</p>

  <p>Although local to some extent, it appears to be common enough in most
  of the counties of England and Wales. In Scotland, it is more or less
  generally common in Roxburghshire and Clydesdale, and is said to have
  been an inhabitant of Perthshire (Moncrieffe Hill). It appears to be very
  local in Ireland, but is recorded from Antrim, Derry, and Kerry, and
  noted as common at Larne in the first-named county. <!-- Page 208
  --><span class="pagenum" title="302.png"><a
  name="page208"></a>{208}</span></p>

<h5><b>Grass Rivulet</b> (<i>Perizoma albulata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Although some English specimens approach the larger and whiter typical
  form, the species as it occurs in the British Isles is generally greyer,
  var. <i>griseata</i>, Staudinger; two examples of this form are shown on
  Plate <a href="#plate83">83</a>, Figs. 10 and 11. In the Shetland Isles,
  the species assumes a darker coloration, and is either well marked on the
  fore wings, as in Fig. 14, or almost plain, as in Fig. 13 (ab.
  <i>thules</i>, Weir), which is an extreme aberration of the form
  <i>subfasciaria</i>, Boheman. In other examples of a deep leaden grey, or
  brown tint, the central area is no darker than the rest of the wing. In
  the Isle of Lewis a white form with faint markings is prevalent, and this
  leads up to a clear white aberration devoid of markings, ab.
  <i>niveata</i>, Stephens, = <i>hebudium</i>, Weir.</p>

  <p>The wrinkled caterpillar, which feeds, in July and August, on the
  seeds of the yellow rattle (<i>Rhinanthus crista-galli</i>), and lives in
  the capsule, is whitish, inclining to greenish, dotted with black, and
  striped with dark green on the back and sides; head, black and glossy;
  plates and first and last rings of the body dusky. (Plate <a
  href="#plate84">84</a>, Fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, sometimes later. It occurs chiefly in
  dry meadows where the yellow rattle flourishes, and is to be seen on the
  wing, often in large numbers, in the late afternoon about sundown.
  Generally abundant in suitable places, throughout the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>The Barred Rivulet</b> (<i>Perizoma bifasciata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Haworth described two forms of this species, and a specimen of each is
  shown on our Plate <a href="#plate83">83</a>. Fig. 4 represents
  <i>bifasciata</i> (<i>bifaciata</i>, the Double-barred Rivulet), and Fig.
  5 depicts <!-- Page 209 --><span class="pagenum" title="303.png"><a
  name="page209"></a>{209}</span><i>unifasciata</i> (the Single-barred
  Rivulet). The chief difference appears to be that in the type
  (<i>bifasciata</i>) the "rivulets" are white and distinct, thus bringing
  out a dark band between the central one and the base of the wing.</p>

  <p>The stoutish caterpillar is pale brown, inclining to ochreous on the
  back, along which are three lines, the central one greyish, and the
  others whitish shaded with greyish; a whitish stripe low down along the
  sides; the usual dots are black, and the spiracles are black, margined
  with ochreous (adapted from Fenn). In September and October it feeds in
  the seed capsules of <i>Bartsia odontites</i>, and is often plentiful;
  Mr. G. F. Mathew records obtaining nearly five hundred from three small
  bundles of the food plant gathered in the Harwich district.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, but is not often seen in the
  daytime, and is not taken very frequently, even when flying at night, but
  it comes to light, and visits flowers.</p>

  <p>From chrysalids obtained from caterpillars reared in 1900, Mr. Robert
  Adkin bred ten moths in 1901, eleven in 1902, two in 1903, five in 1904,
  and two in 1905.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed over England, Wales, and the south
  of Scotland, but it is most frequent in the south of England. Not much is
  known of it in Ireland, but it has been noted from counties Dublin,
  Louth, and Derry.</p>

<h5><b>Heath Rivulet</b> (<i>Perizoma minorata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The British form of this species (Plate <a href="#plate83">83</a>,
  Figs. 9, 12) is rather smaller and darker than typical <i>minorata</i>,
  Treitschke, and as Stephens has figured and described it as
  <i>ericetata</i>, this name should be adopted for our native race.</p>

  <p>The white fore wings have a greyish basal patch and three bands of the
  same colour; the outer one is traversed by a more or less distinct wavy
  whitish line; the band nearest the basal patch is sometimes very faint;
  more rarely the markings are <!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum" title="304.png"
  ><a name="page210"></a>{210}</span>absent from the central area of the
  wings (ab. <i>monticola</i>, Staud.), and a specimen approaching this
  form has been taken in Perthshire.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale green with a dark-green edged ochreous brown
  stripe along the middle of the back, and green stripes on each side; the
  usual dots are black, and the plates on first and last rings are brown,
  as also is the head. It feeds, in September, on the seeds of eyebright
  (<i>Euphrasia officinalis</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, and is found very locally, flying
  in the late afternoon among its food plant, on the moorlands and
  pasture-grounds of Northumberland, Cumberland, Durham, and Westmorland;
  and has been reported from Hawkshead, in Lancashire. In Scotland, it is
  common in suitable parts of Roxburghshire and several localities in
  Clydesdale; thence widely spread to the Orkneys. Only noted from the
  Mourne Mountains in the north-east of Ireland, but probably to be found
  in other parts of that country.</p>

<h5><b>Pretty Pinion</b> (<i>Perizoma blandiata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate83">83</a>, Figs. 7, 8) is also
  known as <i>adæquata</i>, Borkhausen, the name under which it is
  catalogued by Staudinger. As a rule the central band on the whitish fore
  wings is only represented by a round, or sometimes triangular, blackish
  spot on the front margin, a smaller blackish mark on the inner margin,
  and some dusky clouding between these two portions. In specimens from the
  Hebrides the band is more or less complete, and in some of them it is
  very much narrowed, especially towards the inner margin (ab.
  <i>coarctata</i>, Prout).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with three crimson lines, the outer ones
  bent inwards to the central one on the middle of each ring; two lines
  above and one below the yellowish spiracular line are pink; head green,
  tinged and freckled with pink. It <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum" title="305.png"
  ><a name="page211"></a>{211}</span>feeds in September on the flowers and
  seeds of the eyebright (<i>Euphrasia officinalis</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth is out from late May to July, and its habits are similar to
  those of the last species. In Scotland it appears to be commoner than in
  other parts of the British Isles, its range extending from Clydesdale to
  the Hebrides, Orkneys, and Shetland; but it has been recorded from
  Cumberland, and once from Durham. In Wales it has been taken at Dolgelly,
  in Merionethshire. Prout states that in 1902 he secured two specimens
  near Cwm Bychan, and that the species has since been captured regularly
  in the locality. It is widely distributed throughout Kerry and Galway,
  and also recorded from Cork and Derry, in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Barred Carpet</b> (<i>Perizoma tæniata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species is shown on Plate <a href="#plate85">85</a>, Fig. 3.
  There are two forms of the central band of the fore wings, which in the
  type as figured by Stephens is broad, but is narrow in ab.
  <i>arctaria</i>, Herrich-Schaeffer = <i>angustifasciata</i>, Staud. The
  colour of the bands may be greyer or browner than in the specimen
  figured, and the ochreous general colour of the fore wings is more tinged
  with brown in some specimens than in others.</p>

  <p>The rather bristly caterpillar is light brown with a pinkish tinge;
  the back is marked with browner diamonds and some black dots, and there
  is a yellow stripe along the sides. It feeds on moss (Hodgkinson,
  <i>Entom.</i> xxviii. 241) growing in damp places, hibernates when quite
  small, and reappears about April, when it seems to prefer the fruit of
  the moss, but will also thrive on chickweed. The moths appear from the
  end of June, and may be found, but in wasted condition, up to early
  September.</p>

  <p>The species is extremely local, and in its secluded haunts may be
  found on the trunks of holly and yew trees, or it may <!-- Page 212
  --><span class="pagenum" title="306.png"><a
  name="page212"></a>{212}</span>be disturbed from the branches of such
  trees, or from hedgerows, etc.</p>

  <p>In Britain the species seems to have been first noted in Castle Eden
  Dene, Durham (1825), and subsequently in Cumberland (Flimby, near
  Maryport), Westmorland, Lancashire (Arnside and Silverdale), Yorkshire
  (Scarborough), Derbyshire (Dovedale), Arthog in North Wales, and Tintern
  in Monmouthshire. The only English locality for it south of Monmouth is
  Watersmeet, near Lynton, in North Devon. In Scotland, it has been noted
  from Rannoch and Pitlochrie, in Perthshire, and from Dalmallin, in
  Argyllshire. It has a wide distribution in Ireland, and is common in some
  parts of that country, as at Killarney, Co. Kerry, and Rockwood, in
  Sligo.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland; it is represented in Japan by
  <i>fulvida</i>, Butler, and in North America by <i>basaliata</i>,
  Walker.</p>

<h5><b>Yellow Shell</b> (<i>Camptogramma bilineata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This very common and generally distributed species is subject to a
  good deal of variation in the tint of ground colour, and also in the
  greater or lesser amount of black marking. On Plate <a
  href="#plate85">85</a> six specimens are shown; Figs. 4, 5 represent the
  more frequent form in most localities, but in many districts ab.
  <i>infuscata</i>, Gumppenberg (Fig. 6), is hardly less common; in some
  specimens the central band is entirely blackish, and occasionally the
  middle area of the band is partly or wholly whitish. Sometimes the wings
  are uniformly yellow without markings, but such aberrations are scarce,
  or have not been noted often. A small form occurring in the Hebrides and
  the Shetlands, var. <i>atlantica</i>, Staud., has the wings generally
  darkened; Figs. 7-9 depict three specimens from the Isle of Lewis.
  Portraits of two very local Irish forms will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate61">61</a>; one is ab. <i>hibernica</i>, Prout (Fig. 5), and
  the other approaches the dark ab. <i>isolata</i>, Kane (Fig. 6).</p>

  <p>The eggs, which are laid loosely, are yellowish or pale straw colour
  (Plate <a href="#plate84">84</a>, Fig. 3<i>a</i>). Caterpillar, stoutish,
  green inclining to yellowish; three lines on the back, the central one
  dark green, and the others yellowish, as also are the ring divisions; a
  pale wavy line low down along the sides. In some examples the general
  colour is pale greyish-brown, inclining to reddish brown. It feeds on
  grass, dock, chickweed, and various low-growing plants, from August to
  May, and is often abundant in hay meadows (Fig. 3, Plate <a
  href="#plate84">84</a>, is from a coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich). The
  moth occurs throughout the summer, and is very plentiful (often a pest)
  in almost every hedgerow and most bushy places.</p>

<h5><b>July Highflyer</b> (<i>Hydriomena furcata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Some idea of the variable character of this species (<i>sordidata</i>,
  Fab., and <i>elutata</i>, Hübner) may be formed from the selection of
  half a dozen examples shown on Plate <a href="#plate86">86</a>. The
  typical form has the fore wings greyish, with dark bands as in Fig. 1,
  and a modification without the dark bands seems to be ab.
  <i>cinereata</i>, Prout. In the form <i>sordidata</i>, Fabricius, the
  general colour of the fore wings is greenish, and the bands are dark; ab.
  <i>obliterata</i>, Prout, is of the same colour, but the bands are
  absent. Ab. <i>fusco-undata</i>, Donovan, has the general colour reddish,
  with dark bands; without dark bands it becomes <i>testaceata</i>, Prout.
  Blackish or sooty forms are referable to <i>infuscata</i>, Staud. (Fig.
  4). Frequently in the green forms, and less often in the reddish, there
  is a broad whitish central stripe, and a narrow one on the basal area; in
  the green form again the basal and central areas are occasionally crossed
  by red bands, and this is one of the prettiest forms of the species and,
  so far as I know, occurs only in the large sallow-feeding race; <!-- Page
  214 --><span class="pagenum" title="310.png"><a
  name="page214"></a>{214}</span>it possibly represents ab.
  <i>fusco-undata</i>, which is most frequent in the smaller moorland
  race.</p>

  <p>The egg (Plate <a href="#plate87">87</a>, Fig. 1<i>b</i>) when
  figured, February 8, 1908, was whitish as regards the shell, but the
  interior was dark greenish. In April the caterpillar appeared to be
  formed, but it did not leave the shell until early in May.</p>

  <p>The full-grown caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate87">87</a>, Figs. 1,
  1<i>a</i>) is brownish, inclining to blackish; whitish between the rings,
  white lines along the back and sides, and tinged with red along the
  spiracular region. It feeds, in May and June, on sallow, willow, poplar,
  hazel, bilberry, and heather. The moth is out in July and August, but I
  have seen the small bilberry-feeding form (Plate <a
  href="#plate86">86</a>, Figs. 5, 6) on a corner of Exmoor, North Devon,
  in great profusion in late June, whilst in the same district the
  sallow-feeding, larger form appeared about a fortnight later, at which
  time specimens among bilberry were not numerous, and rather shabby in
  appearance.</p>

  <p>Except perhaps in the Shetlands, this species is to be found in all
  parts of the British Isles. It is very common in hedgerows, and around
  the margins of woods; the smaller race frequents woods where bilberry is
  established, and also occurs on mountains and moors.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland, China, Japan, and also to North
  America.</p>

<h5><b>May Highflyer</b> (<i>Hydriomena impluviata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The typical and commoner form of this species is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate86">86</a>, Figs. 7 and 8. The ground colour, usually pale
  green, is sometimes almost white, but more frequently it is tinged with
  greyish brown, thus leading up to the blackish ab. <i>infuscata</i>,
  Prout (Figs. 9, 10).</p>

<p><!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum" title="313.png"><a name="page215"></a>{215}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is brownish grey, or purplish grey, dotted with black
  and dappled with dark brown; of the three lines along the back, the
  central one is black and swells out on the middle of each ring, the
  others are pale; a clear stripe of the ground colour below the black
  spiracles, and a slender line above them. The general colour is sometimes
  pale pinky brown or ochreous. It feeds on alder throughout the summer and
  autumn, and may be found in its domicile of spun-together dry leaves even
  in November, and sometimes later. Occasionally, a few caterpillars will
  feed up quickly, and attain the moth state in July or August, but the
  bulk do not become chrysalids until later in the year, and the moths
  emerge therefrom in May and early June. (Plate <a href="#plate87">87</a>,
  Fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>The species seems to occur, more or less freely, wherever there are
  alders throughout the greater part of the British Isles.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Eastern Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Ruddy Highflyer</b> (<i>Hydriomena ruberata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species is most readily distinguished from the last by the short
  oblique black streak on the tips of the rather narrower fore wings; there
  are also black streaks between the veins and below the tips of the wings,
  as in the last species, but they are generally shorter and often hardly
  traceable.</p>

  <p>The ground colour ranges from pale grey (sometimes with a green
  tinge), through brownish grey to reddish brown; usually central and outer
  marginal bands of a darker shade are present, but these characters may be
  very indistinct or entirely lost in the general coloration. (Plate <a
  href="#plate86">86</a>, Figs. 11 and 12.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale brown, dappled with grey; three dark greyish
  lines along the back; spiracles and the usual dots black, the latter with
  fine hairs; head, reddish brown, plates on first and last rings of the
  body light brown. It feeds, at night, during the summer and autumn, on
  sallow and willow, spinning together the leaves at the top of a twig to
  form a retreat during the day. <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum" title="314.png"
  ><a name="page216"></a>{216}</span></p>

  <p>The moth is found in hedges, woods, and on heaths, in May and June; it
  may be occasionally beaten out of sallow bushes, but flies in the early
  evening, and is then more readily obtained. The species is widely
  distributed, but not generally common, in England and Wales, and in
  Scotland to Perthshire and probably further north, as it is found in
  Orkney, where specimens are numerous but rather small in size, and the
  caterpillars, according to McArthur, feed on heather as well as on
  sallow. Decidedly uncommon in Ireland, but it has been met with, in most
  instances singly, in Armagh, Tyrone, Westmeath, Kerry, Galway, and
  Sligo.</p>

<h5><b>Royal Mantle</b> (<i>Anticlea cucullata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate88">88</a>, Fig. 1) is also known
  as <i>sinuata</i>, Hübner. The white fore wings have a blackish patch at
  the base and a blackish mark on the front margins beyond the middle; the
  former is separated into two parts by a pale reddish-brown band, and
  there is a reddish band, most distinct on the front area, beyond the
  black mark; in some specimens these bands are greyish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, sometimes inclining to yellowish, with two
  black or purplish stripes, enclosing a broader pale yellow one, along the
  back; head, green, freckled with black. It feeds on the flowers of
  bedstraw (<i>Galium mollugo</i>, and <i>G. verum</i>), in July and
  August, or later in some seasons.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in late June and in July, and occasionally may be
  disturbed from its food plant or the surrounding herbage. About dusk it
  is on the wing, and later is attracted by light. It seems to occur in
  most of the English counties from Kent to Cornwall; also in Berks.,
  Oxon., Herts, and the eastern counties. Always local, and except in the
  east, where it is found in the Breck-sand area, most frequent in chalky
  localities. Barrett notes a specimen from Knowle, Warwickshire, and there
  are at <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum" title="315.png"><a
  name="page217"></a>{217}</span>least two records from Scotland
  (Perthshire). In Ireland, Mr. W. F. de V. Kane took one example from a
  wall in co. Clare, and another has been recorded from Galway.</p>

  <p>The range of the species abroad extends to Siberia and Amurland; and
  it is represented in Corea and Japan by <i>A. yokohamæ</i>, Butler.</p>

<h5><b>The Shoulder Stripe</b> (<i>Anticlea badiata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ground colour of the fore wings is pale ochreous brown, inclining
  to whitish; there are three dark-edged black cross-lines, the first of
  them sharply bent below the front margin, the second is rather oblique,
  and the third is wavy and often not clearly defined towards the inner
  margin; the outer marginal area is broadly bordered with pale reddish
  brown or dark purplish brown, there is a black streak from the more or
  less indistinct, whitish submarginal line to the tips of the wings, and a
  white mark about the middle of the line; the ground colour is most in
  evidence on the central area of the wings, but even here it is frequently
  reduced to a slender band, or occasionally only a patch near the front
  margin of the wing. (Plate <a href="#plate88">88</a>, Figs. 2-4.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate89">89</a>, Fig. 1) is green,
  inclining to yellow between the rings; the spiracles are black, and there
  is sometimes a pinkish brown or purplish stripe along their area. Varies
  in general colour, and also in marking. It feeds, at night, on wild rose,
  and may be beaten from the bushes from May to July. When full grown it
  forms an oval cocoon in the earth, and therein changes to a chrysalis
  (Plate <a href="#plate89">89</a>, Fig. 1<i>a</i>), which is dark reddish
  brown, inclining to blackish on the thorax, wing-cases, and the front
  edges of the body rings.</p>

  <p>The moth appears in March and April, and may be obtained from almost
  any hedgerow, where wild rose is plentiful, throughout the British Isles,
  except that it seems not to extend north of Moray in Scotland. <!-- Page
  218 --><span class="pagenum" title="316.png"><a
  name="page218"></a>{218}</span></p>

<h5><b>Barberry Carpet</b> (<i>Anticlea berberata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are greyish or whitish, tinged with grey; there are two
  dark-edged black lines on the basal half, and a black line beyond the
  middle of the wings; the latter has a conspicuous tooth in its upper
  half, but the lower wavy half is indistinct; there is a black streak in
  the tip of the wing. (Plate <a href="#plate88">88</a>, Figs. 5, 6.)</p>

  <p>The stout and roughened caterpillar is brown, with indistinct darker
  stripes along the back; the head is brown, checkered with darker brown.
  It feeds, in June and July, on barberry (<i>Berberis vulgaris</i>); there
  is a second brood in late August and September.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and early June, and again in August. Although
  it certainly has been noted from other parts of England, the species
  seems at present to be confined to the eastern counties. Barrett gives
  Somerset also.</p>

<h5><b>The Flame</b> (<i>Anticlea rubidata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The markings on the reddish fore wings of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate88">88</a>, Figs. 9 and 10) are somewhat similar to those of
  the last mentioned, but there is no black streak in the tips of the
  wings, and the upper part of the outer black line is not toothed. The
  lower central area is often greyish, and the reddish ground colour is
  sometimes obscured.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale brown, sometimes greyish or greenish tinged,
  with obscure darker diamond-shaped marks on the back; a black central
  line, indistinct on the middle rings; under side striped and lined with
  pale and dark brown; head, with a black V-shaped mark. It feeds, in July
  and early August, on bedstraw (<i>Galium mollugo</i> and <i>G.
  verum</i>), and will eat cleavers or goosegrass (<i>G. aparine</i>) in
  confinement.</p>

  <p>The moth flies in June and July, and in the daytime may be readily
  disturbed from hedges in localities on the chalk in the southern half of
  England and Wales, especially in the seaboard counties from Kent to
  Cornwall. It has been recorded from Derbyshire and Yorkshire, and once
  from the Isle of Arran (<i>Entom.</i> xv. 250).</p>

<h5><b>The Streamer</b> (<i>Anticlea nigrofasciaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The two examples of this species depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate88">88</a> show the ordinary form with the central area of
  the fore wings greyish brown (Fig. 7, Essex), and a New Forest specimen
  in which the central area is whitish (Fig. 8).</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar is green, inclining to yellowish between the
  rings; a purplish, or reddish-brown, stripe along the back is broken up
  into spots on the middle rings. It feeds on the flowers and leaves of
  wild rose, and can be found or beaten out in May and June. (Plate <a
  href="#plate89">89</a>, Figs. 2, larva, 2<i>a</i>, ova.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in April and early May, and is often seen at rest on
  palings, etc., but it occurs chiefly in hedgerows, along which it flies
  at dusk.</p>

  <p>This species (also known as <i>derivata</i>, Borkhausen) is pretty
  well distributed over England, Wales, and Scotland up to Sutherlandshire.
  In Ireland it seems to be local.</p>

<h5><b>Dingy Shell</b> (<i>Euch&oelig;ca obliterata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This pale ochreous brown species (Plate <a href="#plate91">91</a>) is
  in the male (Fig. 1) more or less sprinkled and shaded with darker brown,
  and the three brown cross lines are consequently often obscure, and
  rarely as distinct as in the female (Fig. 3).</p>

  <p>The green caterpillar has a yellow line running down the middle of a
  black stripe along the back, and this stripe is <!-- Page 220 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="320.png"><a
  name="page220"></a>{220}</span>bordered on each side with yellow, and
  broken up by the yellow ring divisions; head, with a black spot on each
  side. It feeds, in July and August, on alder.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and early July, and will be found in almost
  every locality in England where the alder flourishes, most plentifully,
  perhaps, on the eastern and western sides. It has been recorded from
  North and South Wales, but it does not seem to have been noted from
  Ireland or Scotland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Small White Wave</b> (<i>Asthena candidata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The delicately lined white moth shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate91">91</a>, Figs. 5 &#x2642; and 6 &#x2640;, is chiefly a
  woodland species. It is generally common in the south of England, occurs
  more or less frequently throughout the northern half, and is widely
  distributed in Wales. In Scotland, it is said to be locally common in
  Clydesdale, and to be found in Arran and in Perthshire. It is plentiful
  at Dromoland, co. Clare, Ireland, not uncommon in parts of Galway, and
  once recorded from Wicklow.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is found, in July and August, on birch, hazel, and
  wild rose. In general colour it is green, inclining to bluish at each
  end, and tinged with yellowish along the ridge on the sides; the back is
  marked with crimson. (Plate <a href="#plate90">90</a>, Fig. 2, after
  Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and sometimes July, and individuals
  of a second generation occasionally appear in August or September.</p>

<h5><b>Small Yellow Wave</b> (<i>Asthena luteata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This pretty little species (Plate <a href="#plate91">91</a>, Figs. 2
  and 4) has the pale yellowish wings marked with ochreous brown lines,
  which vary in thickness, and a dash of the same colour on the fore wings,
  from the central pair of lines to the middle of the outer margin.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds in August and September, on maple, and in
  the northern counties on alder, is green, inclining to whitish between
  the rings.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and early July, sometimes from mid May in warm
  localities. It is widely distributed over England and Wales, and in the
  southern counties of England it occurs in hedges wherever the maple
  grows, but in the midlands and northwards it is chiefly found among
  alder. In Scotland it is local and rare in Clydesdale, and is known to
  occur in Perthshire.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Waved Carpet</b> (<i>Asthena testaceata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The typical, greyish-dusted, white form is depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate91">91</a>, Figs. 7 &#x2642; and 9 &#x2640;. Mr. E. R. Bankes
  states (<i>Entom.</i>, xl. 33) that in one restricted area in mid-Kent
  this species varies in the direction of melanism, and he describes two
  forms as under: ab. <i>intermedia</i> has the usual coloration, but the
  wings are thickly dusted with dusky brown, chiefly along the front edge
  of the fore wings, and the cross lines are more distinct than in the
  type. In ab. <i>goodwini</i> all the wings have the whitish ground colour
  largely obscured by dusky brown powdering.</p>

  <p>The rather spindle-shaped caterpillar is purplish brown, inclining to
  greenish on the sides and below at each end; on the back of the middle
  rings are whitish V-marks, and the last three rings incline to purplish
  red above (adapted from Fenn). It feeds on the young leaves of alder,
  birch, and sallow, in July and August. The moth is out in June, and hides
  by day among the bushes, but may be seen occasionally <!-- Page 222
  --><span class="pagenum" title="324.png"><a
  name="page222"></a>{222}</span>on tree-trunks. Its haunts are in damp
  woods and plantations, and it occurs in most of the English and Welsh
  counties, although it is rarely common, except in the south of England.
  In Ireland it has been noted as scarce in counties Wicklow, Kerry,
  Galway, and Sligo.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Blomer's Rivulet</b> (<i>Asthena blomeri</i>).</h5>

  <p>The earliest British specimens of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate91">91</a>, Figs. 8 &#x2642; and 10 &#x2640;) were taken in
  Castle Eden Dean, Durham, and among the first to detect these was Captain
  Blomer, after whom Curtis named the species in 1832. It is still found in
  that locality, but is also known to occur in Cumberland, Lancs., Yorks.,
  Derby, Staffs., Merionethshire, Worcester, Hereford, Glamorgan,
  Gloucester, Somerset, Devon, Wilts., Oxford, and Bucks.</p>

  <p>The slender caterpillar is yellowish green, generally marked with
  pinkish-brown on the back, but most or all such markings may be absent.
  It feeds, on wych elm (<i>Ulmus montana</i>) (Plate <a
  href="#plate90">90</a>, Fig. 1), in August and September. The moth is out
  in June and July, earlier or later in some seasons. As a rule, it sits on
  the trunks of beech trees, but I have seen it on the stems of cherry and
  fir, though hardly ever on wych-elm. Occasionally, newly emerged
  specimens have been noted on the leaves of dog's mercury (<i>Mercurialis
  perennis</i>).</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Lime-speck Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia oblongata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The characteristic features of this white, or greyish white, species
  (Plate <a href="#plate93">93</a>, Figs. 1 and 4) is the bluish grey
  blotch on the front margin, in the lower end of which is the black discal
  <!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum" title="325.png"><a
  name="page223"></a>{223}</span>spot. Occasionally, the blotch is much
  reduced in size, but it is usually large, and sometimes there are
  indications of a dusky stripe from it to the inner margin.</p>

  <p>When freshly laid, the egg is whitish, but changes to pale orange. The
  caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate92">92</a>, Figs. 2, 2<i>a</i>) is
  greenish, with more or less connected reddish marks on the back, or green
  inclining to yellowish, or bluish, without markings. It feeds through the
  summer on flowers of ragwort, knapweed, scabious, yarrow, golden rod,
  etc.</p>

  <p>The moth, which is often common in gardens, is out from May to August,
  and specimens of a second brood occur in September and October.</p>

  <p>It is widely distributed over the British Islands, but in Scotland it
  does not, apparently, extend north of Perthshire.</p>

<h5><b>Foxglove Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia pulchellata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are pale ochreous brown with a dusky basal patch
  limited by a black line; a greyish central band inclining to blackish
  near the costa, and clouded with ochreous below the middle; the
  black-and-white edges are wavy; a reddish stripe across the wing before
  the central band, and a similar, but more irregular, one beyond the band.
  The hind wings are whitish grey, with several dark-grey bands (Plate <a
  href="#plate93">93</a>, Figs. 7 &#x2642;, 10 &#x2640;).</p>

  <p>In var. <i>hebudium</i>, Sheldon, from the Hebrides, the usual reddish
  stripes are replaced by narrower dark-brown ones; the space left by the
  reduction in width is white, giving the insect a decidedly grey
  appearance.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar lives in the flowers of the foxglove (<i>Digitalis
  purpurea</i>) and feeds therein upon the stamens and the immature seeds.
  It enters by boring through the side walls, and then secures the longer
  lobe of the blossom to the shorter upper one with a few silken threads.
  Tenanted flowers have <!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum" title="326.png"
  ><a name="page224"></a>{224}</span>a rather faded look and are easily
  detected. July is the best month, but the caterpillar may be found
  earlier as well as later.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and is found in almost every part of
  the British Isles where the foxglove is common.</p>

<h5><b>Toadflax Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia linariata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Very similar to the last species, but generally smaller, neater and
  more glossy looking. The central band of the fore wing is blacker,
  without ochreous clouding below the middle, and the edges are not wavy.
  The hind wings are darker, and the only distinct band is a whitish one
  beyond the middle (Plate <a href="#plate93">93</a>, Figs. 3, 6).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish green, with a series of dull olive or
  rust coloured spots or bars along the back, bordered on each side by a
  dusky olive line; in some examples the markings are absent (Crewe). It
  feeds in the flowers of yellow toadflax (<i>Linaria vulgaris</i>), and
  may be reared on flowers of the snapdragon (<i>Antirrhinum</i>). It is
  hardly necessary to examine each blossom separately to find the
  caterpillar, except, perhaps, to make sure when doubtful about the quarry
  being there. Probably, a handful of the flower sprays gathered in August
  or September in any locality in the southern half of England where the
  food plant abounds would furnish moths in the following May or June. The
  <i>Linaria</i> should be secured on a dry day for choice, but when
  brought home it need not be put in water; just throw it into an airy
  breeding cage, and hopefully await emergence of the perfect insects in
  due course. Sometimes caterpillars attain the moth state the same
  year.</p>

  <p>The range of the species in England extends to Durham, but it seems to
  be rather uncommon from the Midlands northwards. It is found in Wales,
  and has been recorded once from Scotland (Inverurie), and once from
  Ireland (Dublin). <!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum" title="327.png"
  ><a name="page225"></a>{225}</span></p>

<h5><b>Marbled Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia irriguata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are whitish and rather shining, the discal spot is
  black and very distinct, but the dark grey-brown markings, which are only
  well defined on the front and outer marginal areas, vary in intensity
  (Plate <a href="#plate93">93</a>, Fig. 9).</p>

  <p>The long, slender and roughened caterpillar is dull yellowish green;
  three lines along the back, the central one reddish and expanded on the
  middle rings, the others yellowish; head, reddish. It feeds on oak, in
  late May and in June. The moth is out in April and May, and is sometimes
  found on fences or palings in the neighbourhood of oak woods, but may be
  jarred from the oak boughs, on the undersides of which it usually
  sits.</p>

  <p>The New Forest in Hants is, perhaps, the best British locality for the
  species, but it has been found in Dorset (Glanville's Wootton), Devon
  (Exeter district, Tiverton, etc.), Sussex (Abbots Wood, St. Leonard's
  Forest, etc.), Wilts. (Savernake Forest); also oak woods in Surrey,
  Berks., Gloucester, Hereford and Glamorgan. On the eastern side it occurs
  in Suffolk (Bury and Needham), and Norfolk.</p>

<h5><b>Dwarf Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia pusillata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate93">93</a>, Fig.
  12) are pale greyish white, discal spot black, cross lines irregular dark
  grey inclining to brownish, usually most distinct on the front
  margin.</p>

  <p>The long, slender caterpillar is orange-red or dull ochreous green;
  three dusky olive lines along the back, the central one often only
  distinct on the front rings; a yellow line low down along the sides. It
  feeds, in June and early July, on spruce (<i>Picea excelsa</i>). The moth
  is out in May and June, and rests by day among the branches of the
  spruce. <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum" title="328.png"><a
  name="page226"></a>{226}</span></p>

  <p>The species is very local, but is found in Kent (West Wickham, etc.),
  Surrey (Mickleham district), Hants (New Forest), Devon (Exeter district,
  Plymouth), Wilts. (Watlington district), and Suffolk.</p>

<h5><b>Ochreous Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia indigata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Captured specimens of this pale greyish-ochreous-brown species nearly
  always have a washed-out appearance, and even freshly emerged examples
  are unattractive. In some specimens, cross lines are more or less
  traceable on the fore wings; in others four or five tiny dusky dots will
  be noted on the front edge; as a rule, the only clearly defined character
  is the black discal spot (Plate <a href="#plate96">96</a>, Fig. 1).</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar is greenish-yellow or yellowish-red; three lines
  on the back, the central one brownish, but often only distinct on the
  front rings; the others, and also one low down along the sides,
  yellowish; head, reddish (adapted from Crewe). It feeds, in June and
  July, on pine and larch, or may be reared on juniper.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and sometimes there seems to be
  another emergence in the latter part of the summer. It frequents
  pine-woods, where it rests upon the trunks and branches of the trees.</p>

  <p>Generally distributed over the whole of England; has been found in
  South Wales, and occurs in Perthshire, in Scotland. In Ireland, it has
  been noted from Tyrone, Derry, and Galway.</p>

<h5><b>Pinion-Spotted Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia insigniata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The greyish white fore wings have a blackish basal line, and three
  slender double lines between this and the outer margin; three blotches on
  the front margin of the wings, the middle one blackish, the others brown
  with dashes of the same colour below; discal spot, black and streak-like
  (Plate <a href="#plate96">96</a>, Fig. 2).</p>

  <p>The long, slightly roughened caterpillar is green, inclining to
  yellowish, especially between the rings; reddish marks on the back
  connected by a slender line of the same colour; head, green, flecked with
  reddish. It feeds, on apple, eating flowers and leaves, in May and June.
  Also said to eat hawthorn and sloe. The moth is out in April and May, but
  it is rarely met with in the open. If, however, one is lucky enough to
  capture a female, and fertile eggs are obtained, moths should hardly fail
  to result. From these the stock might go on increasing year by year for
  quite a long period. Ten specimens presented to the National Collection
  of British Lepidoptera in 1904, by the late Mrs. Hutchinson, were bred in
  April of the previous year, and were the direct descendants of a female
  captured in 1874, at Grantsfield, Herefordshire.</p>

  <p>Other counties in England from which the species has been recorded
  are&mdash;Worcester (Birchwood), Gloucester, Somerset, Wilts., Hants
  (Hayling Island), Sussex, Surrey, Kent, Berks., Bucks., Huntingdon,
  Cambridge (once bred from mixed larvæ beaten from hawthorn on the
  "Gogs"), Suffolk (beaten from hawthorn at Brandon, Tuddenham, etc.), and
  Norfolk.</p>

  <p>As <i>insigniata</i>, Hübner, is claimed to be at least two years
  older than <i>consignata</i>, Borkhausen, the former name will have to be
  adopted for this species.</p>

<h5><b>Netted Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia venosata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This moth has also been named by the old authors "the Pretty Widow
  Moth." On Plate <a href="#plate93">93</a> are shown four examples; the
  typical form (Fig. 2), in which the fore wings are pale greyish, with
  black cross lines, two of which are edged with whitish; var.
  <i>fumosæ</i>, Gregson = <i>nubilata</i>, Bohatsch (Fig. 5)&mdash;the
  Shetland race&mdash;is brownish grey, with the markings obscure; Fig. 8
  <!-- Page 228 --><span class="pagenum" title="332.png"><a
  name="page228"></a>{228}</span>represents a variegated modification of
  the last form, for which the name <i>bandanæ</i> was proposed by Gregson;
  Fig. 11 depicts another specimen, which in its light-brown colour closely
  approaches the Orkney form var. <i>ochracæ</i>, Gregson =
  <i>orcadensis</i>, Prout.</p>

  <p>Specimens from North Devon have a rather darker tone of the typical
  coloration, and those from North Wales and from Ireland incline to
  brownish.</p>

  <p>The rather stumpy caterpillar is greyish brown above, and pale
  greenish or yellowish below; three darker brown lines along the back;
  head, blackish. It is found from late June to early August, in the seed
  capsules of catchfly (<i>Silene inflate</i>, <i>S. maritima</i>, etc.).
  Plate <a href="#plate92">92</a>, Fig. 4, from a coloured drawing by Mr.
  A. Sich.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and is widely distributed over the
  British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>Pimpinel Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia pimpinellata</i>).</h5>

  <p>A portrait of this species, which, as a British insect, was first
  noted in Suffolk nearly sixty years ago, will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate95">95</a>, Fig. 1. The fore wings are pale brownish, except
  on the front edge, which is greyish; the black discal spot is distinct
  and rather long; the median vein and its branches are dotted with black,
  and most of the cross lines are only distinct on the front margin, where
  they are blackish; the rather wavy whitish submarginal line is sometimes
  marked with blackish. In some specimens the costal half of the fore wings
  is greyish, and the other portion only tinged with pale brownish.</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar is green, with three purplish lines along the
  back, the central one wider and more distinct than the others; the head
  is purple. Sometimes purple, with two lines of a deeper shade on each
  side of the back (Crewe). It feeds, in the autumn, on flowers of
  burnet-saxifrage (<i>Pimpinella</i>). <!-- Page 229 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="333.png"><a name="page229"></a>{229}</span>The
  moth is out in June and July, and in the late afternoon is occasionally
  put up from among its food plant or the herbage around, but such
  specimens are rarely worth keeping, unless of the female sex, when eggs
  may be obtained.</p>

  <p>The species has a wide distribution in England, especially in the
  southern half; it occurs in Wales, and also in Ireland, but not in
  Scotland.</p>

<h5><b>Thyme Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia distinctaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This delicately marked species, better known, perhaps, as
  <i>constrictata</i>, Guenée (Plate <a href="#plate95">95</a>, Fig. 4),
  has the fore wings whitish grey, with three slender blackish curved cross
  lines, and some less distinct greyish ones; the outer margin is slightly
  darker, and traversed by a wavy whitish line; discal spot black and
  conspicuous.</p>

  <p>I have not seen specimens from the Hebrides, but, according to
  Barrett, these have a more decided grey tint.</p>

  <p>The rather long, wrinkled caterpillar is dark green, inclining to
  yellowish between the rings, with a broad purplish red line along the
  back. It feeds on the flowers of wild thyme (<i>Thymus serpyllum</i>), in
  August and September.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, and inhabits dry places where there
  is an abundant growth of wild thyme. It is easily alarmed, and quickly
  rises on the wing from its hiding-place among the herbage.</p>

  <p>The species is, or has been, found in most of the southern counties of
  England, from Sussex to Cornwall, on the western side from Somerset to
  Westmorland, including North Wales and the Isle of Man; also recorded
  from Buckinghamshire, Yorkshire (Richmond), and Northumberland. In
  Scotland it occurs chiefly on the west to Ross, and in the Hebrides; in
  Ireland it is widely spread, but most frequently met with on the coast.

  name="page230"></a>{230}</span></p>

<h5><b>Bleached Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia expallidata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ample wings light brown in colour, with large black discal spot,
  and smaller black marks on the front edge of the fore wings, distinguish
  this species (Plate <a href="#plate95">95</a>, Fig. 7) from its closest
  British allies.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds, in September and October, on flowers of golden
  rod (<i>Solidago virgaurea</i>), but it will thrive on those of
  michaelmas daisy, and probably the asters of the garden. It varies in
  ground colour, but this is usually some shade of green, and there are
  brownish spots and lines on the back.</p>

  <p>The moth is out from late June until August, and may be put up from
  among golden rod during the day, or netted as it flies about the plant in
  the gloaming.</p>

  <p>It is rather local, but occurs in most of the southern counties of
  England, from Kent to Devonshire, and westward from Somerset to Hereford
  and South Wales; also recorded from North Lancashire. Rare in Scotland,
  and only noted from Perthshire and Aberdeenshire. Reported from a few
  localities on the coast in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Currant Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia assimilata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate95">95</a>, Fig. 9) is similar in
  marking to that next mentioned, but the wings are shorter and rounder;
  the fore wings are a trifle redder in tint, and the white mark at the
  termination of the submarginal line is usually more conspicuous.</p>

  <p>The rather slender caterpillar, figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate92">92</a>, Fig. 6, from a coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich,
  is yellowish green, inclining to yellow between the rings; three darker
  green lines on the back, the central one most distinct, the others rather
  broad and not well defined; sometimes the central line is tinged with
  brown, as also is the front edge of each ring. It feeds on currant and
  hop, and is said to eat the leaves of gooseberry also. The first brood is
  in June and July, and the second in the autumn. The moth is out in May
  and June and in August. It frequents gardens, and hides among the
  foliage, or occasionally sits on walls or palings; from hedges where the
  wild hop grows freely it may be beaten out in the daytime, but it flies
  in the twilight, sometimes in numbers, around the hop bines.</p>

  <p>Widely distributed over England, Wales, and Scotland up to Ross; in
  Ireland it has been noted from Tyrone, Dublin, Cork, Galway, and
  Sligo.</p>

<h5><b>Wormwood Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia absinthiata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are reddish or purplish brown; cross lines indistinct,
  but represented on the front edge by black marks; discal dot black,
  submarginal line whitish interrupted, often indistinct, except above the
  inner margin (Plate <a href="#plate95">95</a>, Figs. 3, 6, 10). The
  short, stout, and roughened caterpillar varies in colour, and may be
  yellowish green, deep rose colour, or dirty reddish brown; a series of
  lozenge-shaped reddish spots on the back, faint towards each end (often
  absent in green forms); oblique yellow stripes on the sides form borders
  to the marks on the back (adapted from Crewe). It feeds, in the autumn,
  on the flowers of ragwort, golden rod, aster, yarrow, hemp agrimony, etc.
  The moth is out in June and July.</p>

  <p>The species is generally common in the south of England, and is widely
  distributed over the rest of that country, Wales, and Ireland. In
  Scotland its range extends to Moray.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the distribution spreads to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Ling Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia goossensiata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are rather narrower and more pointed at the tips than
  those of the last species; the ground colour of the fore wings is of a
  paler reddish brown, and frequently tinged <!-- Page 232 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="338.png"><a name="page232"></a>{232}</span>with
  greyish; the hind wings are usually greyish-brown (Plate <a
  href="#plate95">95</a>, Figs. 2, 12). The caterpillar, which feeds in
  August and September on the flowers of heath (<i>Erica</i>), and ling
  (<i>Calluna</i>), is pinkish with dusky marks on the back, most distinct
  on the middle rings; a yellowish line low down along the side has dusky
  marks upon it; head, dusky olive, marked with white (adapted from
  Crewe).</p>

  <p>It may be mentioned here, that <i>knautiata</i>, Gregson, which was
  described as a distinct species, is by some authorities considered to be
  a form of this species, whilst others refer it to <i>absinthiata</i>. The
  caterpillar is stouter than that of <i>goossensiata</i>, varies in colour
  from whitish to green, and even purplish-brown, but not to pinkish; it
  feeds on the flowers and seeds of <i>Knautia arvensis</i>. The moth is
  out in June and July, and occurs on heaths and moors throughout England,
  Wales, and Ireland. In Scotland, it is obtained freely in some parts of
  the south, and its range extends to the Orkneys.</p>

  <p>This species is the minutata of Guenée and other authors, but this
  name, being a synonym of <i>absinthiata</i>, will have to be discarded in
  favour of <i>goossensiata</i>, Mabille (1869).</p>

<h5><b>Campanula Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia denotata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The faint reddish tinged pale-brown fore wings distinguish this
  species (Plate <a href="#plate95">95</a>, Fig. 5). The blackish marks on
  the front edge are minute, the cross lines are usually indistinct and
  often absent; the discal spot, however, is black and conspicuous, and the
  whitish submarginal line is very wavy. In general colour, the caterpillar
  is pale brownish; lines and marks on the back, dark brown or blackish. It
  feeds on the seeds of the nettle-leaved bell-flower (<i>Campanula
  trachelium</i>), and may be reared on the flowers of the various kinds of
  <i>Campanula</i> grown in gardens: August and early September. <!-- Page
  233 --><span class="pagenum" title="339.png"><a
  name="page233"></a>{233}</span>The moth is out in July, but is rarely
  seen in a state of nature. Caterpillars, however, are not uncommon, where
  the food plant is plentiful, in several of the English counties from
  Worcestershire southwards to Kent and Cornwall; also in Norfolk.</p>

  <p>This species is the <i>campanulata</i> of most British authors.</p>

<h5><b>Jasione Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia jasioneata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Except that the ground colour inclines to dark greyish brown, and the
  cross markings are rather more in evidence, this species is somewhat
  similar to that last mentioned, pale specimens especially (Plate <a
  href="#plate95">95</a>, Figs. 8, 11). The caterpillar feeds in the seed
  heads of sheep's bit (<i>Jasione montana</i>), is very like that of
  <i>denotata</i> (<i>campanulata</i>), and occurs in the same months.
  Possibly this insect, which is regarded as purely British, may eventually
  be reduced to varietal rank. As pointed out by Mr. Prout, it is in its
  paler form not easily separable from <i>atraria</i>, Herrich-Schaeffer, a
  mountain form of <i>denotata</i>, Hübner. Whether species or variety, it
  is equally interesting to the student of British Lepidoptera from the
  fact that, up to the year 1878, it seems to have been unknown to
  entomologists. From its close allies, it stands out more distinctly than
  do <i>absinthiata</i> and <i>goossensiata</i> from each other, and the
  latter can hardly escape a similar fate if <i>jasioneata</i> is
  degraded.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, but it is very rarely seen at large,
  though caterpillars are found locally in Devon and Somerset, England; at
  Barmouth, in Merionethshire, North Wales; and in Cork and Kerry, Ireland.
  Possibly, it awaits discovery in several other parts of the British
  Isles, and almost certainly in the west of England. In ascertaining new
  localities for the species, the best method of investigation would be to
  search for the caterpillars. <!-- Page 234 --><span class="pagenum" title="340.png"
  ><a name="page234"></a>{234}</span></p>

<h5><b>White-spotted Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia albipunctata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This greyish brown species (Plate <a href="#plate97">97</a>, Fig. 1)
  will be recognised by the white spot at the lower end of the whitish
  submarginal line on the fore wings; not infrequently there is a second
  white spot placed on the line about the middle, and sometimes a third
  near the front margin; the hind wings have a white dot at the anal angle,
  and, occasionally, a second is placed a little beyond. Ab.
  <i>angelicata</i>, Barrett, occurring with the type in the north of
  England, is blackish with the discal spot and the veins showing blacker,
  but without white spots. (Plate <a href="#plate96">96</a>, Fig. 9.) The
  caterpillar is pale lemon yellow, or yellowish green; three brown lines
  along the back, the central one with brown marks upon it; some brownish
  marks on the sides. Variable in general colour, and the markings
  sometimes absent. It feeds on the flowers of angelica (<i>Angelica
  sylvestris</i>), hogweed (<i>Heracleum sphondylium</i>), and other
  Umbelliferæ. It has also been reared on a diet of elder leaves: August,
  September, or even later. Our figure (Plate <a href="#plate92">92</a>,
  Fig. 5) is from a coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich. The moth emerges in
  May and June, sometimes earlier in confinement, and then a second
  generation has resulted in July.</p>

  <p>Widely distributed in England, in many localities the caterpillars are
  not uncommon, although the moth may never be seen at large. Also occurs
  in South Wales, in Scotland to Aberdeenshire; and in Ireland it has been
  found in Sligo and Cork.</p>

<h5><b>Common Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia vulgata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This pug varies in colour from pale grey brown through reddish brown
  to blackish. In some of the lighter coloured specimens, the darker cross
  lines and the whitish submarginal lines are all well defined; more
  frequently, perhaps, most of the markings are indistinct or absent, but
  the small black discal dot and a white spot above the outer angle of the
  fore wing remain fairly clear. (Plate <a href="#plate97">97</a>, Figs. 4,
  7, ab. <i>subfuscata</i>, Haw.) The caterpillar (Plate <a
  href="#plate92">92</a>, Fig. 3) is brownish, inclining to reddish, dotted
  with white; a series of dirty green marks along the back, and a pale
  yellow wavy line low down along the sides. It feeds on the leaves of
  sallow, hawthorn, bramble, bilberry, ragwort, golden-rod and various
  other plants. There are at least two broods in the year, one in June and
  July, and the other in the autumn. The moth flies in May and June, and
  again in August, and is often common, almost everywhere, over the greater
  part of the British Isles.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Eastern Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Golden-rod Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia virgaureata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this obscurely marked species (Plate <a
  href="#plate97">97</a>, Fig. 10) are pale greyish brown inclining to
  ochreous; the discal spot is black, the veins are marked with dark brown
  and white, and the whitish submarginal line terminates in a white spot
  above the inner angle.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar varies in colour from grey brown or purplish grey to
  reddish brown; a series of blackish triangular spots on the back, and
  yellowish oblique stripes on the sides. It feeds on the flowers of the
  golden-rod (<i>Solidago virgaurea</i>), in the autumn; also on ragwort
  (<i>Senecio</i>). The moth is out in May and early June, but in captivity
  there is apparently a second emergence in July and early August. The
  caterpillars from which these smaller and rather darker specimens result,
  hatch from the egg in May and feed on the flowers of beaked parsley
  (<i>Anthriscus sylvestris</i>).</p>

  <p>Widely distributed in England, Wales and Ireland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to north-east Siberia; and the species has
  been recorded from Japan. <!-- Page 236 --><span class="pagenum" title="344.png"
  ><a name="page236"></a>{236}</span></p>

<h5><b>Triple-spotted Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia trisignaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The most noticeable markings on the rather shiny, pale-brown fore
  wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate97">97</a>, Fig. 13) are the
  black discal spot and two blackish clouds above it on the front
  margin.</p>

  <p>The stoutish caterpillar is green, with three darker green lines along
  the back, and a wavy yellowish line low down along the sides; head,
  black. It feeds, in the autumn, on flowers and seeds of angelica and
  cow-parsnip, but the former is its chief food.</p>

  <p>June and July are the months for the moth, but it is rarely met with
  in the open. The only English counties in which the species has been
  noted are Surrey, Sussex, Dorset and Devon in the south; from
  Herefordshire in the west its range extends through Worcester, Warwick,
  Leicester, and Derby to Lancashire and York. In Scotland, Renton records
  it as common at Hawick, in Roxburghshire; and it was recorded from
  Argyllshire in 1902. Hardly known in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Larch Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia lariciata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate97">97</a>, Fig. 3) is very like
  that next referred to, but the fore wings are rather longer, the ground
  colour is whiter, and the dark-grey or blackish cross lines are rather
  more angled and slanting; the hind wings are paler, and especially so on
  the front margins.</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar is bright green, with a darker green line along
  the back, merging into reddish on the last ring; sometimes reddish
  ochreous with the line along the back brownish. It feeds, in June and
  July, on larch, and will also eat spruce.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and early June, and may be jarred from larch
  trees, or sometimes be found at rest on their stems. <!-- Page 237
  --><span class="pagenum" title="345.png"><a
  name="page237"></a>{237}</span></p>

  <p>As a British species, it was first met with in Surrey, in 1862, then
  it was noted in Sussex, and shortly afterwards in Yorkshire. At the
  present time, it will probably be found in any locality where larch is
  plentiful.</p>

<h5><b>Grey Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia castigata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Although, as the English name suggests, this insect is greyish, there
  is always a tinge of ochreous in the composition of its general colour
  (Plate <a href="#plate97">97</a>, Fig. 6). Not infrequently the ground
  colour is decidedly brownish in tint. The markings vary in clearness, but
  are most distinct in the paler forms. A blackish form occurs in the north
  of England, and in the Clydesdale district of Scotland, and was formerly
  known as the "Paisley Pug."</p>

  <p>The longish caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate92">92</a>, Fig. 1) is
  pale or dusky olive, varying to reddish brown, with a series of darker
  marks on the back. It feeds, from August to October, on the foliage of
  almost any plant.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and occasionally a few specimens
  emerge in the autumn. Generally distributed over the British Isles, but
  apparently not noted in the Orkneys and Shetlands.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Plain Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia subnotata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species are pale ochreous brown, inclining to
  pale reddish on the outer marginal area; the most distinct markings are a
  pale cross band beyond the black discal dot, and a pale winding
  submarginal line. The hind wings are smoky grey, with whitish wavy cross
  lines, the most distinct being the outer (Plate <a
  href="#plate97">97</a>, Fig. 9). The stoutish and somewhat <!-- Page 238
  --><span class="pagenum" title="346.png"><a
  name="page238"></a>{238}</span>stumpy caterpillar is green, or pale
  yellowish brown, with three darker lines and marks on the back; a
  yellowish line low down on the sides. It feeds on flowers and seeds of
  orache (<i>Atriplex</i>), and goosefoot (<i>Chenopodium</i>): August and
  September. Figured on Plate <a href="#plate94">94</a>, Figs. 1,
  1<i>a</i>, from coloured drawings by Mr. A. Sich. In July, the moth may
  be disturbed from its food plant or adjacent herbage, or it may be seen
  resting on palings or fences. It flies at night, and will come to
  light.</p>

  <p>Not uncommon in many places in the southern half of England, and found
  in the rest of the country, chiefly on the coast, to Hartlepool in
  Durham, also in Wales. Once recorded from south Scotland, and only noted
  from the coast near Dublin, in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Scarce Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia extensaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The conspicuously marked insect represented on Plate <a
  href="#plate97">97</a>, Fig. 12, is, so far, only known to occur, in
  Britain, on the coasts of Norfolk and Yorkshire. It was first discovered
  in the latter county more than thirty years ago; about twelve years later
  it was found on the Norfolk coast, and caterpillars were also obtained
  from the sea wormwood (<i>Artemisia maritima</i>) in the autumn.</p>

  <p>The long caterpillar, which feeds on the flowers and foliage of its
  food plant, is green, with three lines along the back, the central one
  dusky and the others whitish; a white stripe low down along the sides is
  edged below with rosy brown. It will thrive on the cultivated
  southernwood or "lad's love" (<i>Artemisia abrotanum</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, and may be found in its haunts among
  the sea wormwood, not only on the coast of Norfolk, but quite possibly,
  here and there, in suitable places on the east coast from Essex to the
  Humber. Caterpillars may be obtained in August and September. <a

<h5><b>Edinburgh Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia helveticaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The two examples of this species on Plate <a href="#plate96">96</a>,
  Figs. 3, 4, are from the Pentland Hills, Scotland, and are referable to
  <i>anglicata</i>, Millière. In this form, which is smaller than the type,
  the fore wings are grey brown, more or less tinged with reddish, and
  sometimes inclining to purplish; the whitish edged dark cross lines,
  especially the basal first and second, are usually distinct, and the
  veins are often marked with black and white. Ab. <i>arceuthata</i>,
  Freyer, a paler grey form, occurs in Buckinghamshire, and has also been
  reported from Surrey. The specimens from the latter county, at least
  those from the Dorking district, were subsequently referred to <i>E.
  satyrata</i>.</p>

  <p>The stoutish and rather rough caterpillar is green, with three lines
  along the back, the central one dark green, and the others white; a broad
  yellowish stripe low down along the sides. It feeds on juniper, in June
  and July, and sometimes again in September and October. The moth is out
  in April, May, and June, and a second brood may appear in August and
  September. The species seems to occur among juniper, in Scotland, from
  Roxburghshire to Sutherland. It is local in North Lancashire, has been
  reported from near Llandudno, North Wales, and, as adverted to above,
  occurs in Bucks.</p>

<h5><b>Satyr Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia satyrata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Four specimens are depicted on Plate <a href="#plate96">96</a>. Fig. 5
  represents the typical pale brownish grey form, in which the cross lines
  are indistinct, and the veins are marked with white and dusky. Fig. 6
  shows the rather browner, moorland ab. <i>callunaria</i>, Doubleday, and
  Figs. 7 and 8 depict two forms of the Shetland race, known as var.
  <i>curzoni</i>, Gregson. A much rarer form than <!-- Page 240 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="350.png"><a name="page240"></a>{240}</span>any of
  the above is the pale brownish ab. <i>pernotata</i>, Guenée
  (<i>cauchyata</i>, Meyrick).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greenish with a series of purplish-brown edged,
  dusky green, Y-shaped marks along the back; above the yellow spiracular
  line is a row of slanting purplish blotches; sometimes the general colour
  is paler, and the markings on the back and sides rosy; occasionally, the
  whole of the back is rosy (adapted from Crewe). It feeds on the flowers
  of knapweed (<i>Centaurea nigra</i>), scabious, hawkweed
  (<i>Hieracium</i>), heath, sallow, etc., etc.: August and September.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and is found in woodlands, and on
  heaths and moors. It is widely distributed over the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>Bordered Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia succenturiata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are white, clouded and suffused with dark grey on all
  the margins. The greyish clouding sometimes covers the whole area of the
  wings, except a very limited space under the black discal spot (ab.
  <i>disparata</i>, Hübner). Plate <a href="#plate97">97</a>, Figs. 2, a
  specimen from Lancs., 5, one from Surrey.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is reddish brown, paler in some specimens than in
  others; a series of blackish spear-head marks along the back, connected
  by a blackish line, and a dusky line on each side; a whitish line along
  the spiracles. It feeds, in September and October, on mugwort
  (<i>Artemisia vulgaris</i>), tansy (<i>Tanacetum vulgare</i>), and yarrow
  (<i>Achillea</i>). It may be reared on garden Chrysanthemum. Chrysalis,
  dark buff, inclining to brown; wing cases olive green; figure 7 on Plate
  <a href="#plate92">92</a> is from a photo by Mr. Main, and is enlarged to
  twice the natural size.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and early August; it is not readily put up
  from its hiding-place among herbage, but at night, when on the wing, it
  will come to light. <!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum" title="351.png"
  ><a name="page241"></a>{241}</span></p>

  <p>The species is most frequent, perhaps, on the coast, but it is widely
  distributed over England and Wales. Rare in Ireland, and only noted from
  counties Armagh, Louth, and Dublin; Kane states that he met with it in
  some numbers on Lambay Island. Once reported from Ayrshire, Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Surrey specimen (Fig. 5) appears to be referable to
  <i>exalbidata</i>, Staudinger, a form occurring chiefly in Asia, but
  occasionally found in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.</p>

<h5><b>Tawny Speckled Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia subfulvata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two forms of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate97">97</a>. Fig. 8 represents the reddish typical form, and
  Fig. 11 (from Lancs. coast) the dark ab. <i>oxydata</i>, Treitschke.
  Between these two extremes, there are various intermediate forms, showing
  more or less distinct cross lines.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is reddish brown, with a chain of oval, olive-brown
  spots along the back; there are also two brownish interrupted lines; the
  spiracular line is white. Sometimes the general colour is ochreous brown,
  or grey brown. It feeds, in September and October, on yarrow, and will
  thrive on tansy, and the flowers of garden chrysanthemum.</p>

  <p>The chrysalis of this species is said to differ from that of <i>E.
  succenturiata</i> in being of a rich red colour, inclining to buff on the
  wing cases.</p>

  <p>In July and August, the moth may sometimes be seen resting on fences,
  but it is more frequently hidden away among herbage. At night it will
  visit flowers, especially those of the ragwort.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed over England and Wales, and in
  Scotland up to Moray. In Ireland, it is found on the coast from Louth to
  Cork.</p>

  <p>By some entomologists, <i>subfulvata</i>, Haworth, and its variety,
  <i>oxydata</i>, are set down as forms of the preceding species. <!-- Page
  242 --><span class="pagenum" title="352.png"><a
  name="page242"></a>{242}</span></p>

<h5><b>Shaded Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia scabiosata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The grey, or greyish-brown lined, whitish species shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate97">97</a>, Fig. 14, has been known by three names in
  Britain. It was named and described by Stephens, in 1831, as
  <i>piperata</i> (The Speckled Pug), from a specimen, or specimens, taken
  at Riddlesdown, near Croydon, Surrey; later, it was supposed to be the
  <i>subumbrata</i>, of the <i>Vienna Catalogue</i> (1776), and certainly
  of Guenée. The name given to it by Borkhausen, in 1794, appears to be the
  correct one, and is here adopted.</p>

  <p>Crewe describes the caterpillar as yellowish green, with three dark
  lines on the back, the outer one not clearly defined; a yellow line on
  each side of the head, and of the last ring of the body.</p>

  <p>It feeds on flowers of one of the hawkbits (<i>Leontodon
  hispidus</i>), and hawk's-beard (<i>Crepis taraxacifolia</i>), etc., from
  July to September. In June and early July, the moth may be started up
  from the herbage, as the collector walks over rough ground inland, or
  more frequently on the coast. It also occurs in fens, marshy places in
  woods, etc.</p>

  <p>The species occurs in Bucks., Berks., Surrey, and in the seaboard
  counties from Norfolk in the east to Gloucestershire in the west, also in
  South Wales; in the north it is found in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Durham,
  and Northumberland. It is not common in Scotland, but has been reported
  from various parts, extending from Wigtown to Argyll and Aberdeen. In
  Ireland it is also a coast insect, from Donegal to Cork.</p>

<h5><b>Haworth's Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia haworthiata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate98">98</a>. Fig.
  2) are pale greyish, with dark cross lines, and still darker narrow
  bands; hind wings, similar, but markings less distinct. Resembles <!--
  Page 243 --><span class="pagenum" title="353.png"><a
  name="page243"></a>{243}</span>the last species in size, but the wings
  are somewhat rounder, darker, and not so silky in appearance; the body,
  near the thorax, is ochreous brown. Also known as <i>isogrammaria</i>,
  Herrich-Schaeffer, but <i>haworthiata</i>, Doubleday, is stated by Prout
  to be the older name.</p>

  <p>In July and August the caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate90">90</a>,
  Fig. 3) may be found in the flower-buds of the traveller's joy or old
  man's beard (<i>Clematis vitalba</i>). It is green, with a bluish or
  pinkish tinge, and there are generally three darker stripes along the
  back, but these are sometimes absent; occasionally the ground colour is
  yellowish.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, and may be seen flying about
  clematis in the sunshine, but such specimens are not often worth taking.
  It is easily reared from caterpillars, which will thrive on flowers of
  garden <i>Clematis</i>, and may be obtained by the score, either by
  beating, or by searching for discoloured or black-specked flower buds of
  the traveller's joy.</p>

  <p>The species is most frequent in the south of England, but it occurs in
  all the eastern, some of the midland, and also in the northern counties
  to Lancashire and Yorkshire; in the last-named county, Porritt states
  that the caterpillars were found in profusion on <i>Clematis</i> near
  Wadworth, Doncaster, in 1901, It inhabits South Wales and Ireland.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the species ranges to Amurland and China.</p>

<h5><b>Valerian Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia valerianata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate98">98</a>, Fig.
  3) are brownish grey, with indistinct darker cross lines, and a wavy
  whitish submarginal line; the latter is sometimes not clear, except
  towards the inner angle.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, rather short, bright green, with three darker green lines
  along the back; a whitish line low down along the sides, and the
  ring-divisions are yellow. It feeds, in July <!-- Page 244 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="354.png"><a name="page244"></a>{244}</span>and
  August, on flowers and seeds of all-heal, or cat's valerian (<i>Valeriana
  officinalis</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June; its haunts are in fens, marshes, and
  damp spots affected by its food plant, but, as a rule, is only found in
  the caterpillar state. A local, but widely distributed species in
  England; occurs also in Wales and in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Lead-coloured Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia plumbeolata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The small, obscurely marked species, represented on Plate <a
  href="#plate98">98</a>, Fig. 1, has the fore wings whitish grey,
  sometimes assuming a yellowish tinge; a number of rather wavy, darker
  cross lines, and a more or less clearly defined pale band beyond the
  middle; discal spot always tiny and rarely distinct.</p>

  <p>The stumpy caterpillar is yellowish green, with three purplish-red
  lines along the back, the central one swollen on each ring, and the
  others irregular; sometimes the back is suffused with purplish-red. It
  feeds on the flowers of cow-wheat (<i>Melampyrum</i>) in July and
  August.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and is readily induced to fly out
  from among cow-wheat, or the other herbage around. It may be found in
  most of the English counties, wherever its food plant abounds; in South
  Wales; in Scotland to Argyll and Aberdeen, and in Ireland from Cork to
  Donegal.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Marsh Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia pygmæata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate98">98</a>, Fig. 4) may be
  distinguished from <i>haworthiata</i>, which it approaches in size and
  general appearance, by its more pointed fore wings and the white dot at
  the inner angle of these wings. <!-- Page 245 --><span class="pagenum" title="355.png"
  ><a name="page245"></a>{245}</span></p>

  <p>The long, thin caterpillar is yellowish green; a pale olive line along
  the middle of the back, connecting a series of urn-shaped blotches of the
  same colour; two pale olive, irregular lines on each side. It feeds, in
  June and July, on flowers of stitchwort (<i>Stellaria holostea</i>).</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, sometimes later; examples of a second
  brood have been obtained in August and September. It flies in the
  afternoon, but only when the sun shines, and where the food plant grows
  freely.</p>

  <p>The species occurs in all the eastern counties of England, in Bucks.,
  and in the northern counties to Cumberland and Northumberland. In Wales
  it has been recorded from Colwyn, Denbighshire; in Scotland it is widely
  spread to Perthshire; it is local and scarce in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Slender Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia tenuiata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are rather rounded; grey, more or less tinged with
  brownish, and with ochreous or reddish brown along the front edge; the
  latter with dusky clouds upon it; the cross lines are dark grey brown and
  fairly distinct, and the discal spot is black (Plate <a
  href="#plate98">98</a>, Fig. 5). A large grey form from Moray, in
  Scotland, has been named <i>cineræ</i>, Gregson.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, rather stumpy, and dingy yellowish green in colour, the
  sides and middle of the back rosy; a series of dusky spots, edged by
  black lines or short streaks, along the back; and a row of pinkish
  oblique stripes on the sides. It feeds, in the spring, in sallow catkins,
  and the moths may often be bred in numbers, in June and July, from those
  catkins which fall most readily from the bushes when we go "a sallowing."
  Moths frequently rest on the stems, and where there is a clump of
  well-grown sallows, a good series may be obtained.</p>

  <p>The species is partial to fens and marshy places, and is found in such
  situations over the greater part of the British Isles. <!-- Page 246
  --><span class="pagenum" title="356.png"><a
  name="page246"></a>{246}</span></p>

<h5><b>Maple Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia inturbata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings are greyish brown, with many darker cross lines; the
  outer margin is darker and traversed by a pale line; discal dot, dark
  grey and not very distinct (Plate <a href="#plate98">98</a>, Fig. 6).
  This species was long known as <i>subciliata</i>, Guenée, but is now
  referred to <i>inturbata</i>, Hübner.</p>

  <p>In May and June the caterpillars may be beaten from maple, which is
  apparently the only food plant, and of which they have a decided
  preference for the flowers. When full grown the larva is yellowish green
  with a purplish stripe along the back, and whitish lines along the
  sides.</p>

  <p>The moth may be jarred from the branches of the maple in July and
  August; it is occasionally seen resting on fences, etc. It seems to be
  found in England and Wales, in most places where there is a mature growth
  of maple.</p>

<h5><b>The Angle-barred Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia innotata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The greyish-brown fore wings of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate98">98</a>, Fig. 7) are crossed by darker oblique lines,
  which are angled on the front margin; the submarginal line is white and
  irregular, especially at each end.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, ochreous grey, inclining to pinkish, marked on the back
  with white-edged, purplish- or reddish-brown blotches, and on the sides
  with reddish or purple spots; a whitish line low down along the sides. It
  feeds on the flowers of wormwood and mugwort (<i>Artemisia</i>), from
  August to October.</p>

  <p>The moth, which is uncommon and very local in England, is out in July.
  It occurs in Devonshire (Exeter district), Kent (Wye), Essex
  (Shoeburyness), Lincolnshire (Skegness, etc.), Worcestershire (Malvern),
  Lancashire and Cheshire (coast sand-hills, Macclesfield, etc.), and
  Durham (Hartlepool). <!-- Page 247 --><span class="pagenum" title="357.png"
  ><a name="page247"></a>{247}</span></p>

<h5><b>Ash Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia fraxinata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Very similar to the last mentioned, but smaller, and the markings are
  less distinct (Plate <a href="#plate98">98</a>, Fig. 8).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is variable, but generally some shade of green,
  occasionally purplish red; lines on the sides yellowish, and sometimes
  there are dusky purplish marks on the back. It feeds, in August and
  September, on ash, and is said to eat <i>Artemisia</i>,
  <i>Laurustinus</i>, and the flowers of scabious. The moth is out in late
  June and July, and sometimes a second generation appears in the
  autumn.</p>

  <p>This species, which by some entomologists is considered to be a form
  of <i>E. innotata</i>, is widely distributed over England, south
  Scotland, and Ireland. <i>Tamarisciata</i>, Freyer, is also considered by
  some authorities to be a form of <i>E. innotata</i>.</p>

  <p>Some moths reared from larvæ obtained, in 1905, from Tamarisk, in
  Cornwall, have been referred to <i>tamarisciata</i>.</p>

<h5><b>Narrow-winged Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia nanata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The rather variable species represented on Plate <a
  href="#plate99">99</a>, Figs. 1 and 2, will easily be recognised by its
  long pointed fore wings, which in colour are whitish grey, darkened by
  brownish cross-stripes; a whitish spot before the small, black discal
  dot.</p>

  <p>The long, thin, caterpillar, which feeds on ling or heather in the
  autumn, is whitish with a greenish tinge: the sides are marked with red,
  and there are some reddish spots on the back.</p>

  <p>On almost all heather-clad ground throughout the British Isles, this
  pretty little moth will be found, more or less commonly, during the
  months of May and early June, and sometimes there is a second flight in
  July and August. <!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum" title="358.png"
  ><a name="page248"></a>{248}</span></p>

<h5><b>Brindled Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia abbreviata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The ochreous grey fore wings of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate99">99</a>, Fig. 3) are crossed by dark, bent lines, and
  marked with black on the veins; the central area is sometimes whitish,
  and generally paler than the ground colour.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, slender, ochreous brown in colour, with browner lines and
  redder V-shaped marks on the back. It feeds on oak, in June and July. The
  moth is not uncommon in oak woods, in April and May, and may be beaten
  from the boughs in the daytime, and not infrequently found resting on the
  trunks. Generally distributed, but in Scotland not noted north of
  Perthshire.</p>

<h5><b>Oak-tree Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia dodoneata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate99">99</a>, Fig. 5) differs from
  the last in being smaller, paler in colour, more distinctly marked, and
  with a rather larger and more conspicuous discal spot.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds, in June and July, on young leaves of oak, the
  flowers of the evergreen oak (<i>Quercus ilex</i>), and hawthorn. It is
  orange, or ochreous red, with blackish marks connected by a line of the
  same colour along the back, and yellowish stripes and lines on the
  sides.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and early June, and occurs in some of the woods
  in most of the southern counties of England, and on the west to
  Worcestershire. It has been recorded from Yorks. and Cumberland; from
  Glamorganshire, South Wales; and from counties Armagh, Dublin, Wicklow,
  and Sligo, in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Mottled Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia exiguata</i>).</h5>

  <p>In some respects this species (Plate <a href="#plate99">99</a>, Fig.
  4) is not unlike <i>E. abbreviata</i>, but the general colour of the fore
  wings is pale grey inclining to brownish; a good character is the
  blackish <!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum" title="359.png"><a
  name="page249"></a>{249}</span>band before the submarginal line, which is
  interrupted by patches of the ground colour, one above, and the other
  below, the middle; the submarginal line is whitish towards the inner
  margin.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, long and thin; dark green; a series of yellow dotted
  reddish marks on the back, and a yellow-edged reddish line low down along
  the sides. It feeds, in the autumn, on hawthorn, sloe, currant, sallow,
  ash, etc.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, and is sometimes seen at rest on the
  stems and branches of trees, fences, etc., and may be beaten out of
  hedgerows.</p>

  <p>Widely distributed throughout England, Wales, Scotland to Perthshire,
  and Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Juniper Pug</b> (<i>Eupithecia sobrinata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two specimens are shown on Plate <a href="#plate99">99</a>: Fig. 6
  represents a more or less typical example from the Surrey downs, and Fig.
  7 a pale form from Forres in Scotland. The species varies in tint of
  ground colour, and in the strength of marking, in all its localities; but
  in Scotland there is a greater tendency to pale forms than in England.
  Mr. H. McArthur, during the present year, obtained an extensive and most
  variable series from heather, at Aviemore, in Inverness. A pale-brownish
  tinged white pug found in Kent and the Isle of Wight, at one time
  referred to <i>E. ultimaria</i>, Boisduval, and afterwards known as
  <i>stevensata</i>, Webb, is really, according to Prout, <i>anglicata</i>,
  Herrich-Schaeffer. Whether this is a form of the present species or
  specifically distinct is still left in doubt, but personally I believe it
  to be a variety.</p>

  <p>The dark-green, sometimes reddish marked, caterpillars may be beaten
  from juniper bushes, from April to early June. The moth is out from late
  July to early October, and may be found <!-- Page 250 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="360.png"><a name="page250"></a>{250}</span>in
  nearly all parts of the British Isles where the food plant occurs, and
  occasionally in localities from which juniper appears to be absent.</p>

<h5><b>Double-striped Pug</b> (<i>Gymnoscelis</i> (<i>Eupithecia</i>) <i>pumilata</i>).</h5>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:22%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Double-striped Pug, at rest.</b></p>

    <p style="text-align:center">(Photo by W. J. Lucas.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>This species varies a good deal in the tint of the ground colour and
  the cross markings. Three forms are depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate99">99</a>: Fig. 8 is a typical male, and Fig. 9 shows a
  female with distinct red bands (ab. <i>rufifasciata</i>, Haworth); both
  specimens are from Surrey. The greyish example without red markings (Fig.
  10) is from Ireland, and approaches ab. <i>tempestivata</i>, Zeller, in
  form.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar ranges in colour from yellowish-green to reddish; on
  the back there is a dark-green or blackish line, and often a series of
  marks of the same colour; the lines on the sides are yellowish. It feeds
  chiefly in or on the flowers of furze, broom, holly, clematis, hawthorn,
  etc., from May to September. There are certainly two broods, possibly
  more. The specimens of the first, or spring, generation are usually
  larger in size and more strongly marked than those of the summer
  brood.</p>

  <p>The moth is most frequent, perhaps, in April, May, July, and August,
  but it may be met with in either of the months from April to November.
  Pretty generally distributed over the British Isles, including the
  Hebrides and the Orkneys. <!-- Page 251 --><span class="pagenum" title="361.png"
  ><a name="page251"></a>{251}</span></p>

<h5><b>Cloaked Pug</b> (<i>Eucymatoge togata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Over sixty years ago, this fine pug (Plate <a href="#plate99">99</a>,
  Figs. 11 and 12) was detected in England. It was first noted in a
  plantation of spruce fir at Black Park, Buckinghamshire, in mid-June,
  1845, and for many years this was the only known British locality. At the
  present time it is obtained more or less regularly in the New Forest, and
  has been recorded, chiefly in single specimens, from Wiltshire, Essex,
  Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Yorkshire, and Durham. It is not uncommon in
  Scotland up to Inverness, but is most plentiful in Perthshire.</p>

  <p>Kane (<i>Catalogue of the Lepidoptera of Ireland</i>) states that it
  is spreading over an extensive area in Ireland, as a result of the
  planting of spruce fir.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds in the spruce cones, and eats the
  immature seeds, is dingy white with a pinkish tinge, and suffused with
  blackish above; the lines along the back and sides, when present, are
  whitish but not distinct; head, and raised dots on the body, black; a
  brown plate on the first ring: July and August. Cones containing
  caterpillars may be secured by visiting a known locality for the species
  towards the end of August, especially immediately after a gale.</p>

  <p>The moth may be dislodged from its resting place among the branches of
  the spruce in June, sometimes earlier or later.</p>

<h5><b>V-Pug</b> (<i>Chloroclystis coronata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is "<i>Phalæna</i>" <i>v-ata</i>, Haworth, and also the V-Pug of
  that author. A later English name for the species is "The Coronet Pug,"
  an Anglicism for the Latin specific name, and has reference to the black
  upper part of the outer cross line which is twice angled and bears a
  fanciful resemblance to a <!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum" title="362.png"
  ><a name="page252"></a>{252}</span>coronet; the lower angle is, however,
  most distinct, therefore Haworth's English name seems most suitable as it
  indicates the V-mark, which is a noticeable character of this delicate
  green species. (Plate <a href="#plate100">100</a>, Fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish green, with three reddish lines along the
  back, the central one most distinct and sometimes forming triangular
  marks, or lozenges. The ground colour varies, and may be greener,
  yellower, or occasionally greyish; and the markings are not always
  present.</p>

  <p>There are two generations, the first in June and July, and the second
  in the autumn, and in confinement a third brood is sometimes obtained.
  The blossoms of various plants are eaten, but those of hemp-agrimony
  (<i>Eupatorium cannabinum</i>), golden-rod (<i>Solidago</i>), clematis,
  and purple loosestrife (<i>Lythrum salicaria</i>), are perhaps
  favourites. Hawthorn and bramble have also been mentioned as food
  plants.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in most of the months from May to August, but seems to
  be most frequent in the first named.</p>

  <p>Generally distributed in the southern half of England, extending into
  South Wales, rare in Yorkshire and in Roxburghshire, Scotland. Widely
  distributed in Ireland. The range abroad extends to Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Green Pug</b> (<i>Chloroclystis rectangulata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Of this variable species five examples are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate100">100</a>. Figs. 2 and 3 represent the typical and more
  usual forms; 3 varies in the direction of ab. <i>subaerata</i>, Hübn.,
  and Fig. 4 is the greyish ab. <i>cydoniata</i>, Bork. Ab.
  <i>nigrosericeata</i>, Haworth (Fig. 6), is blackish with white
  submarginal line; and an intermediate form (Fig. 5) may be referable to
  ab. <i>sericeata</i>, Haworth.</p>

  <p>The stumpy caterpillar is of a pale yellow green colour, with <!--
  Page 253 --><span class="pagenum" title="363.png"><a
  name="page253"></a>{253}</span>a more or less distinct reddish or
  dark-green line along the back, and reddish ring-divisions. It feeds in
  flowers of the wild apple or crab, and of apples and pears grown in
  orchards and gardens. It is found in April and May, and the moth is out
  in June and July.</p>

  <p>The species is common throughout the greater part of England and
  Wales, and its range extends to Ross in Scotland. It has a wide
  distribution in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Bilberry Pug</b> (<i>Chloroclystis debiliata</i>).</h5>

  <p>As a British insect, this species (Plate <a href="#plate100">100</a>,
  Figs. 7 and 8) was first found in Devonshire, and was then known by the
  English name of "The Devon Pug." As the yellowish green caterpillar,
  marked with a darker line along the back and a yellowish one low down on
  the sides, feeds on bilberry, in April and May, and is by no means
  confined to Devonshire, the popular name here adopted is more
  suitable.</p>

  <p>When quite fresh the moth, which is out in June and July, has a very
  delicate tinge of green, but this quickly fades out, leaving a pale
  greyish white insect. In the typical form (Fig. 7) the black central
  lines are fairly well defined, but in ab. <i>nigropunctata</i>, Chant
  (Fig. 8), the lines are represented by a series of dots.</p>

  <p>The species is common in some of the sheltered hollows among the hills
  in Devon and Somerset, and I used to find it in abundance in the
  Martinhoe district, in the former county. The moths were rarely disturbed
  from the food plant during the day, but towards dusk they flew in numbers
  around small trees of mountain ash. Other counties in which it is known
  to occur are&mdash;England: Cornwall, Worcester, Staffordshire,
  Leicester, and Lancashire (formerly on Chat Moss). Wales: Glamorgan and
  Pembroke. Scotland: Aberdeen. Ireland: Wicklow, Waterford, Cork, Kerry,
  and Sligo. <!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum" title="364.png"><a
  name="page254"></a>{254}</span></p>

<h5><b>Dentated Pug</b> (<i>Collix sparsata</i>).</h5>

  <p>At one time this greyish brown species (Plate <a
  href="#plate102">102</a>, Figs. 1, 2) was known by the English name of
  "Broom Scallop," but it is now usually referred to, in the vulgar tongue,
  as the Dentated Pug. The hind wings have their outer margins toothed
  rather than scalloped, and the insect has nothing to do with broom.</p>

  <p>The rather long caterpillar is pale green, with four white lines along
  the back, and one on each side; a whitish stripe along the black
  spiracles. Head, pale brown, rather flat above. (Adapted from Porritt.)
  It feeds on the yellow loosestrife (<i>Lysimachia vulgaris</i>), in July
  and August, or even later. Fens and marshy woodlands are the haunts of
  the moth, which is out in June and early July. It hides among the coarser
  vegetation, and is not always easily disturbed therefrom; neither is it
  often noticed when on the wing at night, although it is sometimes found
  at the flowers of buckthorn.</p>

  <p>Localities for the species are the fens of Cambridge and Norfolk, the
  boggy parts of the New Forest, Hants; Dorset (Bloxworth and Hyde, etc.);
  Cheshire (Delamere Forest); Yorkshire (bogs near York, and Thorne
  Waste).</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Dark Spinach</b> (<i>Pelurga comitata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The darker banded, pale ochreous species shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate102">102</a>, Figs. 3 &#x2642;, 4 &#x2640;, varies in the
  colour of the band to brownish; the central area of this band is almost
  always pale ochreous or whitish, to a greater or lesser extent.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, stout and roughened; ochreous inclining to reddish, and
  tinged above with greenish; a series of V-shaped marks along the back,
  yellow oblique darker on the sides, and a greyish edged pale wavy line
  low down along the sides. <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum" title="365.png"
  ><a name="page255"></a>{255}</span>The figures 2, 2<i>a</i>, on Plate <a
  href="#plate94">94</a> are from coloured drawings by Mr. A. Sich.</p>

  <p>It feeds in the autumn on the flowers and seeds of various kinds of
  goosefoot (<i>Chenopodium</i>), also on Orache (<i>Atriplex</i>). The
  moth is out in July and August, and may be found among its food plants
  and other low herbage growing in waste places, more particularly those on
  sandy coasts. Around the borders of market gardens, especially those in
  the south of London, and in Kent and Surrey, it is often very common. The
  species probably occurs more or less freely in suitable places almost
  throughout the British Isles.</p>

  <p>Its range abroad extends to East Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>Slender-striped Rufous</b> (<i>Phibalapteryx lapidata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The rather pointed fore wings are pale brownish, and are crossed by
  several fine wavy and rather darker lines, and three more distinct,
  slightly curved lines, one of which is at the base and two are on the
  central area. The outer margin of the hind wings, which are pale brown,
  more or less shaded with dusky, is irregular. (Plate <a
  href="#plate102">102</a>, Fig. 6.)</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, whitish-yellow above, inclining to pale buff below; lines
  of grey freckles along the back and sides, the lower one broader and
  darker; head, grey, freckled with darker. According to Hellins, who
  reared it from the egg, it feeds in May and June, on traveller's joy
  (<i>Clematis vitalba</i>). The natural food is doubtful, but is said to
  be grass, whilst Kirby states that in the South of France the caterpillar
  eats evergreen oak.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in September and early October, and is found in
  Scotland on the hills, in rough grassy and rush-covered spots, at
  elevations ranging from 300 to 800 feet. In Ireland, it is not uncommon
  in Antrim, Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, <!-- Page 256 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="366.png"><a name="page256"></a>{256}</span>and
  Limerick. Barrett states that a specimen has been taken at Shap Fell in
  Westmorland.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to East Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>Many-lined Moth</b> (<i>Phibalapteryx polygrammata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The female example of this species, represented on Plate <a
  href="#plate102">102</a>, Fig. 5, is from Germany; the male is somewhat
  paler and the central markings less distinct. This form is var.
  <i>conjunctaria</i>, Lederer, and most of the specimens formerly obtained
  in the Cambridgeshire fens, chiefly Burwell and Wicken, were referable to
  it. The species has not been seen in its old fenland haunts for very many
  years, and it is probably now extinct in Britain. Specimens have been in
  the past (and still continue to be) recorded from other British
  localities, but these on investigation are found to be cases of mistaken
  identity. <i>C. vittata</i> = <i>lignata</i> bears a strong likeness to
  <i>P. polygrammata</i>, and is often confused with it, but in the latter
  the outer band does not run to the tips of the fore wings, as it does in
  the former species.</p>

<h5><b>Small Waved Umber</b> (<i>Phibalapteryx</i> (<i>Coenocalpe</i>) <i>vitalbata</i>).</h5>

  <p>At first sight this moth (Plate <a href="#plate102">102</a>, Fig. 7)
  might be mistaken for a small specimen of the Waved Umber (<i>Hemerophila
  abruptaria</i>), but it will be noted that the dark stripe on the fore
  wings starts from the middle of the inner margin, and runs to just below
  the tips of the wings; the outer margin of the hind wings is not wavy,
  and the antennæ of the male are not pectinated.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds on traveller's joy (<i>Clematis
  vitalba</i>), in June-July, and in September-October, is greyish <!--
  Page 257 --><span class="pagenum" title="367.png"><a
  name="page257"></a>{257}</span>brown, with three blackish lines along the
  back, the central one broader than the other two, especially on the
  middle of each ring, where it swells out into a black spot.</p>

  <p>In May and June, and again in August, the moth may be disturbed from
  the food plant growing in masses in hedgerows, etc. It occurs in most of
  the southern counties of England, westward to Herefordshire and South
  Wales, and eastward to Suffolk. Forsythe states that it is local in the
  Lancaster district.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Fern</b> (<i>Phibalapteryx</i> (<i>Coenocalpe</i>) <i>tersata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The general colour of this species (Plate <a href="#plate102">102</a>,
  Fig. 8) is pale brown, with a tendency to reddish in some specimens, and
  to greyish in others.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, pale brownish inclining to ochreous; on each side of an
  irregular blackish line along the centre of the back is a pale yellowish
  line, and there are white spots on the back of the middle rings. It feeds
  on <i>Clematis</i>, in August and September. The moth is out in June and
  July, and will be found in similar localities to those mentioned for the
  previous species, and, except that it has not been recorded from
  Lancaster, its range in England is much about the same.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad extends to Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Oblique Carpet</b> (<i>Coenocalpe vittata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species, also known as <i>lignata</i>, Hübner, is usually pale
  brown in ground colour, tinged with ochreous or pinkish; the darker
  oblique stripes vary in width and in intensity. (Plate <a
  href="#plate102">102</a>, Figs. 9 &#x2642;, gen. 1; 10 &#x2642;, gen.
  2.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is of a yellow-green colour, inclining to <!-- Page
  258 --><span class="pagenum" title="368.png"><a
  name="page258"></a>{258}</span>ochreous brown on the upper portions of
  the middle rings; a darker irregular line along the back, and a whitish
  line on each side, the latter edged above and below with a fine black
  line; below the spiracles is a pale pinkish brown stripe. Varies in the
  tint of ground colour and in the markings. It feeds, after hibernation,
  on bedstraw (<i>Galium palustre</i>, <i>G. saxatile</i>, etc.), and
  caterpillars from eggs laid in June may be reared on clematis, wild or
  cultivated.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, sometimes later, and a second
  generation appears in August and September; the individuals of the later
  brood are often smaller than those of the first brood. Its haunts are
  fens, marshes, and water-meads, but in Middlesex I have taken a specimen
  or two flying along a weedy ditch. Widely distributed throughout the
  British Isles, but not noted in Scotland north of Moray.</p>

<h5><b>The Gem</b> (<i>Percnoptilota fluviata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Also known in the vulgar tongue as "The Narrow-barred Carpet." As will
  be seen on reference to Plate <a href="#plate102">102</a>, the male (Fig.
  12) is pale brown with a dark central band; and the female (Fig. 11) is
  purplish brown, the central band rather blackish, and on it is the discal
  mark, a black centred white spot. The specimens figured are rather
  small.</p>

  <p>The following aberrations have been named&mdash;ab. <i>marginata</i>,
  Mathew, with the fringes of all the wings conspicuously pinky-grey; ab.
  <i>olivacea</i>, Mathew, a form of the female with olive brown fore
  wings; ab. <i>obsoleta</i>, Mathew, a form of the male with the dark
  central band nearly or quite absent.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greyish, sometimes tinged with pink, and sometimes
  with green; three dusky lines on the head and first three rings of the
  body, a series of blackish outlined, whitish marks on the middle rings,
  and blackish marks on the other rings, which are pale in colour; a
  blackish line above the black-edged spiracles is broken up into dashes on
  the middle rings. Several other forms of the caterpillar, which is a
  variable one, have been described by Hellins. The food comprises
  groundsel, knotgrass, chrysanthemum, and various other plants. There are
  several generations during the year, and in hot weather the caterpillars
  feed up rapidly, so quickly indeed that in about a month the whole round
  of changes from egg to moth is effected. The species is migratory in
  habit, and there is little doubt that the specimens taken in this country
  in late spring or early summer are immigrants; those examples obtained
  later in the year are probably the descendants of such aliens. It is more
  frequently noted from southern England, chiefly from the seaboard
  counties, but it has been recorded from Lancashire and Yorkshire; also
  from Wales, and from several parts of Ireland: April to November.</p>

<h5 class="lg125">BOARMIINÆ.</h5>

<h5><b>Clouded Magpie</b> (<i>Abraxas sylvata</i>).</h5>

  <p>A more or less typical example of each sex of this variable species
  will be found on Plate <a href="#plate103">103</a>. Fig. 7 represents a
  male, and Fig. 8 a female; the slightly marked specimen (Fig. 6) somewhat
  approaches the continental species <i>A. pantaria</i>, L., in appearance,
  and it is probable that such individuals have done duty for the species
  just named in some of the older collections of British lepidoptera. On
  Plate <a href="#plate104">104</a> are shown the leaden tinted form (Fig.
  6), sometimes not infrequent in certain Yorkshire localities; a specimen
  with smoky fore wings (Fig. 7), taken with a few other examples of the
  same form in a wood in Buckinghamshire, in 1907, when also the strongly
  banded form (Fig. 8) was secured by Mr. A. J. Scollick. Between these
  <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum" title="372.png"><a
  name="page260"></a>{260}</span>extremes and the more typical forms all
  kinds of intergrades occur, but it is not possible here to discuss these
  in detail.</p>

  <p>The pale greenish yellow eggs and two caterpillars are figured on
  Plate <a href="#plate101">101</a>, Figs. 2, 2<i>a</i>. The latter are
  whitish, inclining to yellowish on the back, and lined with black; stripe
  below the black spiracles, yellow; head, black and glossy. The food is
  wych-elm (<i>Ulmus montana</i>), but beech and hazel are said to be eaten
  at times: August to October. The moth is found in May and June, sitting
  about on the leaves of dog's mercury, and other vegetation in its
  woodland haunts. Although it sometimes occurs sparingly in the southern
  seaboard counties, it is far more frequent in the west, ranging from
  North Devon to Cumberland, and including Wales. It is common in Bucks.,
  and northwards to Northumberland, and extends into South Scotland. In
  Ireland, not uncommon at Killarney, and reported from a few other
  localities.</p>

<h5><b>The Magpie</b> (<i>Abraxas grossulariata</i>).</h5>

  </div>

  <p>Except that the specimen represented by Fig. 2 has traces of a yellow
  band on the hind wings, Figs. 1-3 on Plate <a href="#plate103">103</a>
  show this highly variable species in its typical and most frequent form.
  Figs. 4 and 5 depict examples of the ordinary darker forms leading up to
  ab. <i>hazeleighensis</i>, Raynor, in which the whole of the fore wing
  area between the orange bands is blackish, except two tiny white specks
  near the front margin. Not infrequently the black spots on the outer
  margin of the fore wings exhibit a tendency to spread inwards, as in
  Figs. 2 and 5, and very occasionally they unite with the series of spots
  outside the orange band, as in Plate <a href="#plate104">104</a>, Fig. 1,
  which represents a specimen (kindly lent by Mr. R. Adkin) with blackish
  tinged hind wings. Sometimes the ground colour of all the wings is
  yellowish (ab. <i>lutea</i>, Cockerell), but the markings <!-- Page 261
  --><span class="pagenum" title="373.png"><a
  name="page261"></a>{261}</span>are of the usual pattern. The example of
  this form (Plate <a href="#plate104">104</a>, Fig. 3) was reared from a
  large number of caterpillars I collected at Purley, in Surrey, a year or
  two ago, and was the only example among the moths resulting therefrom
  that was worth retaining. The very fine variety shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate104">104</a>, Fig. 5, is ab. <i>varleyata</i>, Porritt, which
  occurs in Yorkshire, but is mostly reared in captivity from eggs obtained
  from a wild female in the first place, and subsequent pairings; the
  specimen figured is an especially fine example of the female sex, raised
  among others of the same form by Mr. G. T. Porritt of Huddersfield, who
  has been good enough to lend it for the purpose. Several other varieties
  of this species have been named and described by the Rev. Gilbert H.
  Raynor, but reference can only be made here to two of these; one is ab.
  <i>melanozona</i>, a Scottish form, in which there is a black blotch with
  traces of yellow in it at the base of the fore wings; a large black
  discal spot in the white central area; a black band, widening towards the
  front margin, before the faint yellow band, the latter followed by four
  black spots; hind wings with central black spot, and two series of black
  <!-- Page 262 --><span class="pagenum" title="374.png"><a
  name="page262"></a>{262}</span>spots beyond, seven in each series,
  separated by a well-defined white area. Fig. 2 on Plate <a
  href="#plate104">104</a> represents a specimen that approaches this
  variety. The handsome cream-coloured specimen (Plate <a
  href="#plate104">104</a>, Fig. 4) is ab. <i>lacticolor</i>, Raynor, and I
  am obliged to Mr. Adkin for the loan of these insects also.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar and chrysalis are figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate101">101</a>, Figs. 1, 1<i>b</i>; the former is creamy white,
  marked on the back with black blotches and dots, and lines of black dots
  on the sides; between the lower two rows is a broad reddish line; head,
  black; sometimes the whole body is black. It occurs in gardens, and
  sometimes is a serious pest where currants and gooseberries are
  cultivated; it frequently abounds on <i>Euonymus japonicus</i>. In the
  open country it feeds on sloe and hawthorn; sometimes it is found on elm
  (low growth in hedges), apple, navelwort (<i>Cotyledon umbilicus</i>),
  orpine (<i>Sedum telephium</i>), and in the Hebrides, on ling
  (<i>Calluna</i>). August to May, or early June, are the months in which
  it is found as a rule; occasionally it does not hibernate, but feeds up
  and attains the moth state in the autumn of the year that it hatches from
  the egg. The moth is out, normally, in July and August, and is generally
  distributed over the greater part of the British Isles.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to East Siberia, China, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Clouded Border</b> (<i>Lomaspilis marginata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Figs. 1 and 2 on Plate <a href="#plate107">107</a> represent the more
  usual forms, in both sexes, of this rather common, but pretty, little
  moth. Occasionally, specimens are obtained in which, with the exception
  of a dark patch or two on the front margin, the wings are entirely white
  or slightly tinged with pale yellowish (ab. <i>pollutaria</i>, Hübner); a
  modification of this form is shown in Fig. 3.</p>

  <p>Ab. <i>nigrofasciaria</i>, Schöyen, has a rather broad blackish band
  across the central area of each wing, and indications of such bands, in
  the shape of spots or dots, are seen in many examples of the species;
  occasionally, the irregular dark border of the outer margin of the wings
  is traversed by an interrupted whitish line.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish-green, with three dark-green double lines
  on the back, the central one blotched with purplish brown on the last
  ring; head, green, marked with purplish brown. The figure (Plate <a
  href="#plate105">105</a>, Fig. 2) is from a drawing in colour by Mr.
  Sich. It feeds on sallow, willow, and aspen, and may be found almost
  throughout the summer from June. The moth is also met with during the
  summer months, but seems to be most frequent in May and June. The species
  prefers moist localities where sallows abound, and in such places seems
  to occur pretty generally over the British Isles. In Scotland, however,
  it has not, apparently, been noted north of Moray.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Scorched Carpet</b> (<i>Ligdia adustata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The bluish-grey band on the outer third of the fore wings varies in
  width, and the velvety black marking thereon varies in amount; this area
  of the wings is also more or less clouded with reddish brown, and the
  underside of all the wings is much suffused with reddish brown, which
  gives the insect the burnt or scorched appearance to which both Latin and
  English names refer. (Plate <a href="#plate107">107</a>, Figs. 4 &#x2642;
  and 5 &#x2640;.) In June and early July, and again in late August and
  September, the red-spotted, bright-green caterpillar may be beaten from
  the spindle bushes (<i>Euonymus europæus</i>) in hedgerows. (Fig. 1,
  Plate <a href="#plate105">105</a>, is from a coloured drawing by Mr.
  Sich.) <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum" title="378.png"><a
  name="page264"></a>{264}</span></p>

  <p>The moth is out in late April sometimes, but it is more frequent in
  May and June, and as a second generation in August, earlier or later in
  some seasons. It may be knocked out of hedges in which spindle is
  growing. The species is not uncommon in most of the southern English
  counties, but in the northern ones its occurrence is more casual. It has
  been recorded from North Wales; in Ireland it is fairly common in some
  western and southern counties, and rare in the east and north; in
  Scotland, only noted from the south-east, Arran, and the Hebrides.</p>

  <p>Abroad, its range extends to Japan, where it is represented by var.
  <i>japoniata</i>, Staudinger.</p>

<h5><b>The Sloe Carpet</b> (<i>Aleucis</i> (<i>Bapta</i>) <i>pictaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This blackish-grey species (Plate <a href="#plate107">107</a>, Fig. 6)
  has been confused in the past with <i>pictaria</i>, Thunberg, which is
  referable to <i>Cleora lichenaria</i>, and it was then known by the
  popular name of "The Grey Carpet." As the caterpillar feeds on the
  foliage of the sloe, and the moth is fond of resting on the stems and
  twigs, and appears at the time the bushes are wreathed in their snowy
  blossoms, the sloe carpet seems to be rather more suitable than are most
  of the names by which our moths are popularly known.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is dusky brown, with blackish V-shaped marks upon the
  back, white marks on rings 7 and 8, and a black line on the last ring. It
  feeds at night, in June and early July, and as it remains on the bushes
  during the day, it may be obtained by beating. At night the moths fly
  about the bushes for a short time, and then sit on the twigs, when they
  may be secured. Of course, a lantern will be a necessity.</p>

  <p>Barrett states that stunted bushes on open heaths and hillsides are
  preferred to hedgerows. <!-- Page 265 --><span class="pagenum" title="379.png"
  ><a name="page265"></a>{265}</span></p>

  <p>The species is very local, but generally not uncommon where it occurs,
  as, for example, in the New Forest, Hampshire; the Loughton and
  Colchester districts, Essex; and in some parts of Kent. It has been noted
  from Tilgate Forest, and other localities in Sussex; and also from
  Surrey, Berkshire, and Suffolk.</p>

<h5><b>White-pinion Spotted</b> (<i>Bapta bimaculata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The two cross lines on the fore wings of this silky white species
  (Plate <a href="#plate107">107</a>, Fig. 9) commence in blackish spots on
  the front margin; often they are only indicated by series of dots, and
  are rarely really distinct. Occasionally, a greyish submarginal line or
  band is present.</p>

  <p>The darkish green caterpillar has a series of purplish marks on the
  back; head, inclining to yellowish, and powdered with purplish. It feeds,
  in June and July, on the leaves of wild cherry and plum, and will eat
  hawthorn; it may be beaten from its food plant in the daytime. The moth
  is out in May and June, and shelters in bushes, etc., in woods and
  hedgerows. During the day it is frequently put up from its hiding-places,
  but its usual time of flight is the evening, when it is readily seen and
  not difficult to capture. It is local, and perhaps most frequently met
  with in those parts of South England where the wild cherry flourishes.
  Occurs more or less commonly in most of the southern counties, but north
  of Gloucester, Oxford, and Norfolk it has only been noted from North
  Lancashire, Westmoreland, and Cumberland. In Wales the late Mr. C. G.
  Barrett found the moth rare in Pembrokeshire, and there is also a record
  from Anglesey.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to China, Corea, and Japan. <!-- Page 266
  --><span class="pagenum" title="380.png"><a
  name="page266"></a>{266}</span></p>

<h5><b>Clouded Silver</b> (<i>Bapta temerata</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its silky, white wings this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate107">107</a>, Figs. 7 &#x2642;, 8 &#x2640;) is similar to the
  last mentioned. It is, however, rather larger, and there are greyish
  clouds on each side of the outer cross line, but there are no blackish
  spots on the front edge of the fore wings. The clouding referred to is
  heavier and darker in some specimens than in others, but occasionally,
  chiefly in the female, is almost absent.</p>

  <p>The green caterpillar, when full grown, is ornamented with
  brown-bordered reddish spots on the back, but these markings are absent
  in its earlier stages. The head is paler than the body, and has a reddish
  spot on each side. It feeds, in July and August, on sloe, plum, and bird
  cherry in this country, but the continental authors give birch, willow,
  rose, etc. The moth is out in May and June, and occurs throughout England
  and Wales, to Cumberland; but it is far more frequent in the south than
  in the north. Barrett mentions a single specimen from Wigtownshire in
  Scotland. In Ireland, Kane states that it is abundant at Clonbrock,
  Merlin Park, and in several other localities in Galway; it is not
  uncommon at Killarney, Kerry; and a few specimens have been taken at
  Powerscourt, Wicklow, and Sligo.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Common White Wave</b> (<i>Cabera pusaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form (Plate <a href="#plate107">107</a>, Figs. 10, 11)
  this white species has three dark-grey almost parallel cross lines on the
  fore wings and two on the hind wings. The first or the second of these
  lines on the fore wings may be absent, occasionally both may be missing
  and the third very faint. Not infrequently in undersized bred specimens
  the first line approaches the second line either throughout its length or
  near the inner margin, and more rarely the two are united; in most of
  such aberrations the tips of the fore wings are rather more rounded than
  in typical specimens, and these are referable to ab. <i>rotundaria</i>,
  Haworth (Round-winged Wave). I have over a dozen examples of this form,
  all of which were reared from caterpillars which had been kept on short
  rations when nearly mature; in some, the outer margin of the fore wings
  is distinctly rounded, but in others it is much the same as in the larger
  typical form, and one of these is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate107">107</a>, Fig. 12. The ground colour occasionally assumes
  a greyish tint, and sometimes this is tinged with pink; more rarely the
  general colour is leaden grey.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, of which there are two broods, one in July and
  another in September, feeds on birch, alder, sallow, etc. It is purplish
  brown, spotted with white above, and greenish below on the first three
  rings. There is also a green form with purplish brown marks on the back.
  (Plate <a href="#plate105">105</a>, Fig. 3, from a coloured drawing by
  Mr. A. Sich.) The moth is out in May, June, and August, and is generally
  common throughout the greater part of the British Isles.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to East Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Common Wave</b> (<i>Cabera exanthemata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Somewhat similar to the last species, but sprinkled with ochreous
  grey; the fore wings have three greyish cross lines, the first two less
  regular than those of <i>pusaria</i>, and the outer one distinctly
  curved; variation in the lines is pretty much the same as in
  <i>pusaria</i> and its small form ab. <i>rotundaria</i>. Of the form
  showing the first and second lines more or less confluent, I have seven
  examples reared from collected caterpillars; six are undersized, but the
  other is of quite ordinary size (ab. <i>approximata</i>, Haworth);
  another specimen, also bred, is thinly <!-- Page 268 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="384.png"><a
  name="page268"></a>{268}</span>powdered with ochreous grey, and the lines
  are very indistinct. The more usual forms are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate107">107</a>, Figs. 13, 14.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, inclining to yellowish or to brownish; some
  purplish-red marks and white-edged black spots on the back; the ring
  divisions are yellow, and there are reddish-brown or purplish-red marks
  on the sides; the markings vary. It feeds on birch, alder, and sallow,
  and may be beaten out at any time from July to September. The moth is out
  through the summer from May; its range in the British Isles is very
  similar to that of the last species, but it seems to have a preference
  for moist places.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad extends eastward to Amurland, and a form known
  as ab. <i>schæfferi</i>, Bremer, occurs in the last-named country, and
  also in Corea and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Barred Umber</b> (<i>Numeria pulveraria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Pale ochreous or reddish brown freckled with darker; the central dark
  reddish brown band is sometimes much narrowed below the middle; sometimes
  only the edges of the band are dark, the enclosed space being but little
  darker than the ground colour, or occasionally tinged with greenish; one
  example of the latter and two of the former were reared this year (1908)
  from larvæ received in July, 1907, from Mr. F. Pope of Exeter; a male
  specimen bred from the same batch of larvæ, but which emerged in August
  of the year last mentioned, is distinctly tinged with rosy over all the
  wings; the narrow band on the hind wings, not usually extended to the
  front edge, is in this specimen entire, whilst the greenish-banded
  specimen referred to above is without trace of a band on the hind wings.
  Two examples which are without locality, but which, I believe, came from
  the New Forest, have pale greyish-brown fore wings banded with brown in
  which there is a tinge of olive. Two examples of the male are figured on
  Plate <a href="#plate108">108</a>. The eggs (Plate <!-- Page 269 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="385.png"><a name="page269"></a>{269}</span><a
  href="#plate106">106</a>, Fig. 2<i>a</i>) were pale greenish yellow when
  laid, May 17 to 20; the larvæ hatched out from May 31 to June 2.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which is also depicted on the plate, is reddish
  brown, mottled with yellowish brown. It feeds on birch, sallow, ash,
  etc., from June to August.</p>

  <p>The moth, as a rule, does not emerge until the following spring, but
  sometimes specimens will come out the same year.</p>

  <p>Although widely distributed over nearly the whole of the British
  Isles, the species seems to be rarely met with in large numbers. The
  range abroad extends to Amurland, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Barred Red</b> (<i>Ellopia</i> (<i>Hylaea</i>) <i>prosapiaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The typical form of this species is depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate108">108</a>, Figs. 4 &#x2642;, 5 &#x2640;, and Fig. 3 on the
  same plate represents ab. <i>prasinaria</i>, Hübner, a form not uncommon
  in Germany (whence came the example figured), Switzerland, and other
  parts of the continent, but which is very rare in Britain, and has been
  recorded from Kent and Suffolk. Sometimes, but chiefly in Scotland, the
  colour varies to a greyish or even yellowish tint; the cross lines are
  often parallel or nearly so, and frequently approach each other about the
  middle; the usual white edging to the cross lines is occasionally absent,
  and the enclosed space in such specimens is hardly darker than the
  general colour.</p>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate106">106</a>, Fig. 1, will be found a figure
  of the caterpillar, which is tawny brown with white-edged, connected
  reddish marks along the back. It feeds, from September to May, on Scots
  pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>), and occasionally on larch. The moth is
  out in June and July, and sometimes in September. It may be jarred from
  the pine boughs, and is not infrequently seen resting on foliage of the
  undergrowth. Generally distributed in fir-woods throughout Great Britain,
  and widely spread in Ireland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to East Siberia. <!-- Page 270 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="386.png"><a name="page270"></a>{270}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Light Emerald</b> (<i>Metrocampa</i> (<i>Eudalimia</i>) <i>margaritaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>When quite fresh, this species (Plate <a href="#plate108">108</a>,
  Fig. 6) is of a delicate whitish-green colour, but the green tint is apt
  to fade or to change colour, so that the wings are almost ochreous white
  sometimes.</p>

  <p>The eggs shown on Plate <a href="#plate106">106</a>, Fig. 3, were
  kindly supplied by Mr. Norman Riley.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar ranges in colour from greenish brown to purplish
  brown, and is frequently freckled with a darker shade of the general
  colour; there is sometimes a pale patch on rings 6 and 7, and the sides
  are fringed with fine bristles along the spiracle area. It feeds, from
  September to May, on the leaves of oak, birch, beech, elm, etc., and
  during the winter will nibble the bark of the younger twigs, and also eat
  the buds.</p>

  <p>The moth, which is partial to the woodlands, is out in June and July,
  and is pretty generally distributed over the British Isles, except the
  Hebrides, Orkneys, and Shetlands.</p>

<h5><b>Large Thorn</b> (<i>Ennomos autumnaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This fine species was first definitely ascertained to occur in Britain
  in 1855, but it had been reported as British at a much earlier date, and
  was figured by Wood in 1839. Up to 1859 it had only been recorded from
  the North Foreland and Margate in Kent, and from Brighton, Sussex. In
  1862, a specimen was taken at Brighton and one at Deal, the latter a
  female. Two examples were secured at Gosport, Hampshire, in 1865, and one
  at Deal in 1867. Then, after an interval of ten years, three were
  captured in Hants (Alverstoke), and two years later a round dozen were
  obtained at Gosport. During the last thirty years specimens have been
  recorded from Margate, Deal, Dover, Folkestone, Hythe, and Ashford
  (1907), in Kent, from Chichester, Sussex, and from Shoeburyness, Essex
  (1898). It has been reared on several occasions from eggs obtained from
  captured females, and is still more frequently bred from eggs deposited
  by the descendants of wild parents.</p>

  <p>The eggs are deep olive, with a white ring at one end; and the
  caterpillar is brownish in colour, rather shining, and very twig-like. It
  feeds on birch, alder, hawthorn, sloe, plum, etc., and has been found on
  sycamore and cherry; May to August. The early stages are figured on Plate
  <a href="#plate106">106</a>, Figs. 1, 1<i>a</i>. The moth (Plate <a
  href="#plate109">109</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 3 &#x2640;), which varies in
  colour from pale to deep ochreous yellow, and also in the amount of
  purplish brown freckling, usually has the upper part of the outer
  marginal area some shade of tawny brown. Specimens of a greyish chocolate
  tint have recently been reared by Mr. Newman, of Bexley (Plate <a
  href="#plate134">134</a>, Fig. 9). Most of the specimens captured in
  England have been obtained at light in the autumn. The range abroad
  extends to Amurland, Japan, and North America.</p>

<h5><b>August Thorn</b> (<i>Ennomos quercinaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The male (Plate <a href="#plate109">109</a>, Fig. 2) is generally
  yellower than the female (Fig. 4), and it is in the former sex that
  brownish or red-brown clouding on the outer area beyond the second cross
  line appears most frequently, but it occurs also in the female (Plate <a
  href="#plate109">109</a>, Fig. 5). Sometimes the wings are partly or
  entirely dull reddish brown. Two other examples of the type form showing
  modification of the cross lines will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate111">111</a>, Figs. 5 &#x2642;, 6 &#x2640;. In ab.
  <i>carpinaria</i>, Hübner, the wings are of a reddish ochreous colour. A
  hybrid resulting from a crossing of <i>E. alniaria</i> &#x2642; and <i>E.
  quercinaria</i> &#x2640; has been named <i>dartfordi</i>, Tutt.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate113">113</a>, Fig. 3) is
  generally grey brown, mottled with reddish or olive; but, according to
  Fenn, it is <!-- Page 272 --><span class="pagenum" title="390.png"><a
  name="page272"></a>{272}</span>sometimes greenish, without humps or
  projections. It feeds, in the summer, on lime, birch, oak, hawthorn, etc.
  A chrysalis which I took out of its puparium (two leaves spun together
  with silk) on July 9, 1907, was green, with the upper surface tinged with
  yellowish; a dark-green central line, and a series of dark-green
  irregular marks on each side; the tail pointed and furnished with reddish
  hooks.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in August and September, and may often be seen sitting
  on the boles of trees, generally low down. The species is widely
  distributed over England, but is much more frequent in the south than in
  the north. It has been recorded from Swansea in Wales; from Dumfries,
  Dunoon, and Monteith, in Scotland; and from near Derry, Hazlewood
  (Sligo), Mote Park (Roscommon), and Clonbrock (Galway), in Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Canary-shouldered Thorn</b> (<i>Ennomos alniaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate111">111</a>, Figs. 1, 2) is
  generally easily recognised by the canary yellow coloured hairs of the
  thorax. The fore wings are yellowish, sprinkled with purplish grey, and
  crossed by two curved greyish-brown lines, which not infrequently fall
  close together on the inner margin. In some female specimens that I
  reared from eggs, received from York, the wings are more or less tinged
  with dull tawny brown, especially on the outer area, and in two of them
  the thorax is also brownish tinged.</p>

  <p>The at first green, and afterwards blackish slate-coloured, egg, with
  whitish ring, and the caterpillar are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate110">110</a>, Fig. 2, 2<i>a</i>. The latter is brownish,
  mottled with purplish above, and inclining to greenish below; head,
  rather paler brown. It feeds, from May to July, on birch, alder, etc. The
  moth is out in the autumn, and occurs in suitable woodland and marshy
  places over England, Wales, and Scotland to Moray. It has been found in
  many parts of Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Dusky Thorn</b> (<i>Ennomos fuscantaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Figs. 3 &#x2642;, 4 &#x2640;, Plate <a href="#plate111">111</a>,
  represent the usual form of this species; in some specimens the outer
  marginal pale purplish-brown shading spreads inwards over the fore wings
  to the base; in other examples it is only seen on the upper part of the
  outer area.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate110">110</a>, Fig. 3) is green,
  pretty much of the same tint as the underside of the ash leaf upon which,
  and the stalks, it rests by day. In some examples the general colour
  inclines to pale brown, or reddish brown. It may be found during the
  summer, and where the leaves are seen to have neat round holes in them,
  these should be examined, when this caterpillar will probably be found
  somewhere adjacent. Ash (<i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) is the usual food,
  but possibly privet might answer as a substitute. The moth is out in
  August and September, and occurs in most parts of Southern England where
  the ash flourishes; its range extends into South Wales, and northwards to
  Durham and Northumberland. Only doubtfully recorded from Ireland, and
  apparently unknown in Scotland.</p>

<h5><b>September Thorn</b> (<i>Ennomos erosaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species, shown on Plate <a href="#plate134">134</a>, Fig. 6,
  varies in ground colour from pale ochreous to pale fulvous; the cross
  lines approach towards the inner margin, and sometimes the second line is
  bent inwards below the middle. The central spot is generally absent, and
  when present is exceedingly faint. The twig-like caterpillar is brownish,
  with a greenish or purplish tinge. In its infancy it is a smooth-looking
  creature, but as it advances in growth knobs and humps appear, the most
  prominent of which are on rings 2, 5, 8, and 11; on the <!-- Page 274
  --><span class="pagenum" title="394.png"><a
  name="page274"></a>{274}</span>last ring there are two points. It feeds
  on oak chiefly, but will eat birch, lime, etc.: May to July. The moth is
  out in August and September, and occurs more or less frequently in most
  of the southern counties of England, but is rather scarce in the Midlands
  and northwards. It occurs in South Wales, and has been recorded from the
  south of Scotland. Very rare in Ireland.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;The species of <i>Ennomos</i> are
  fond of light, and in suitable spots, gas and electric lamps, in the
  streets, or even in the house when windows are open, will attract these
  moths. Most of the specimens of <i>autumnaria</i> that have been captured
  in Britain have occurred at light. <i>Quercinaria</i> is, perhaps, less
  often noted at light than its allies; but, curiously, this species is
  more frequently seen at rest on tree trunks, etc., than are either of the
  other kinds. Female moths taken at light may not always be in first-rate
  condition, but they will probably lay eggs, and should be kept for that
  purpose in a chip box. The caterpillars do not hatch out until the
  following spring. Put the eggs in a cool place.</p>

<h5><b>Early Thorn</b> (<i>Selenia bilunaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The sexes of the spring or typical form are depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate112">112</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;, and the paler
  summer form var. <i>juliaria</i> (July Thorn), Haworth, is represented by
  Fig. 3. The underside is shown in Mr. H. Main's photo of the moth in its
  natural resting attitude.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is orange or reddish brown, sometimes inclining to
  purplish; there are pairs of reddish raised points on the back of rings 7
  and 8; as will be seen from the accompanying illustration, which is from
  a photograph by Mr. Main, the creature, when resting, is very like a
  twig. It feeds on birch, alder, sallow, hawthorn, sloe, etc., in May and
  June, and again in August and September. The moth is out in April and
  <!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum" title="395.png"><a
  name="page275"></a>{275}</span>early May. In 1905, a male occurred at
  Carnforth, Lancs., on June 8; the second generation appears in July and
  August. A third has been obtained in captivity, and the moths of this
  brood are similar to those of the second. It has happened that the
  emergence of some moths of the second, or summer, form has been delayed
  until the following February, but these remained true to their race and
  did not assume the spring form.</p>

  <p>Generally distributed throughout England and Wales, and often
  abundant, especially in the south. In Scotland, Renton states that it is
  common in Roxburghshire, but there is only one brood; the range extends
  to Sutherlandshire. Widely spread in Ireland and plentiful in some parts.
  <!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum" title="396.png"><a
  name="page276"></a>{276}</span></p>

<h5><b>Lunar Thorn</b> (<i>Selenia lunaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>A female of this species is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate112">112</a>, Fig. 4; the male is usually more clouded with
  reddish. A second generation is sometimes raised in captivity, and the
  males of this brood (var. <i>delunaria</i>, Hübner) are somewhat paler,
  whilst the females incline to a yellowish tint. In Scotch specimens, the
  reddish markings are tinged with purple; and ab. <i>sublunaria</i>,
  Stephens, from Derbyshire, has the coloration very similar to that of the
  spring form of <i>S. tetralunaria</i>.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is figured on Plate <a href="#plate113">113</a>, Fig.
  2. The ground colour is usually some shade of brown, ranging from greyish
  or greenish to reddish, variegated with darker or paler clouds, and with
  traces of pale lines on the back. It occurs in the open from July to
  September, but may be reared both earlier and later in confinement. It
  feeds on sloe, plum, oak, birch, etc. The moth, in May and June, is
  sometimes seen on hedges or on the plants growing below; or it may be
  jarred from the branches of trees, when it is more apt to fall to the
  ground than to fly. Like others of this group it is fond of light, and is
  frequently attracted thereto at night. The species is rarely plentiful,
  and always more or less local, but it is widely distributed over the
  British Isles to the Orkneys.</p>

<h5><b>Purple Thorn</b> (<i>Selenia tetralunaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate112">112</a>, Fig. 5 represents a specimen of
  the spring brood, and Fig. 6 one of the summer brood (var. <i>æstiva</i>,
  Staudinger). The ground colour of the typical form is whitish, sometimes
  tinged with grey, and sometimes with pinkish; the patch at the tip, and
  the basal two-thirds of the fore wings, also the basal half of the hind
  wings, are purplish brown, varying almost to blackish; or they may be
  rich red brown. Var. <i>æstiva</i> is rarely whitish in ground colour,
  but this is frequently of a pinkish tinge, and the darker portions of the
  wings are brownish, inclining to olive; sometimes the general colour is
  ochreous brown with dark brown cross lines, and a rust-coloured lunule at
  the tips of the fore wings. The hybrid resulting from a female of this
  species that had paired with a male <i>bilunaria</i> has been named
  <i>parvilunaria</i>, Bastel. At the time it is laid, the egg is pale
  olive green, but it changes to shining reddish, and just before hatching
  to purplish black. (Plate <a href="#plate113">113</a>, Fig.

<p><!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum" title="399.png"><a name="page277"></a>{277}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is reddish brown, mottled with darker brown, and with
  pale greyish. It feeds on birch, alder, oak, sallow, cherry, etc.: June
  and July, and again in the autumn. (Plate <a href="#plate113">113</a>,
  Fig. 1.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in April and May, and the second generation emerges in
  July and August. A few specimens of a third generation have been reared
  in October, but this is unusual.</p>

  <p>The species is more or less local, and rarely common, at least in the
  moth state; it occurs in all the southern counties of England, and a few
  specimens have been recorded from some of the midland and northern
  counties, and from South Wales. In Scotland, only noted from Rannoch,
  Perthshire, and a specimen was reared on April 25, 1901, from a
  caterpillar found at Dunkeld, in the same county, the previous
  autumn.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Lilac Beauty</b> (<i>Hygrochroa</i> (<i>Pericallia</i>) <i>syringaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The sexes of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate112">112</a>, and it will be noted that the male (Fig. 7) is
  rather smaller and decidedly more brightly coloured than the female (Fig.
  8). An older English name is "Richmond Beauty," Wilkes. Figures of the
  curiously shaped caterpillar and chrysalis will be found on Plate <!--
  Page 278 --><span class="pagenum" title="400.png"><a
  name="page278"></a>{278}</span><a href="#plate115">115</a>, Figs. 2,
  2<i>a</i>. The former is yellowish brown, variegated with reddish and
  violet; it feeds on honeysuckle, lilac, and privet, and may be beaten or
  searched for in May and early June, after hibernation. I have found it
  commonly on privet hedges in the Mill Hill district, Middlesex, but in
  woods, and especially in the New Forest, it is obtained from honeysuckle.
  In my experience, the privet-feeding caterpillars always produce larger
  moths than those reared from caterpillars fed on honeysuckle. The moth
  emerges in June and July, the former month chiefly in confinement, and
  from such early moths a second generation may be obtained in the
  autumn.</p>

  <p>Although most frequent in the southern half of England and Wales, the
  range of the species extends to the northern counties; and single
  specimens have been recorded from Durham and Northumberland, but the
  species has not been noted in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Scalloped Hazel</b> (<i>Gonodontis bidentata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species varies in ground colour, from pale whity brown through
  shades of grey brown, olive brown, ochreous, and dark brown to black; the
  blackish cross lines of the fore wings are generally edged with white,
  but the edging is sometimes absent, and occasionally it alone remains
  distinct; the central space enclosed by the cross lines is often darker
  than the general colour, and not infrequently it is faintly reddish.
  Figs. 1 and 2, Plate <a href="#plate114">114</a>, represent two of the
  more usual forms of the species. Fig. 3 is the black ab. <i>nigra</i>,
  Prout, which occurs on the mosses of Lancashire, and in Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>The yellowish and brown mottled, purplish caterpillar is figured on
  Plate <a href="#plate115">115</a>, where also are shown the eggs
  (turquoise blue, changing to reddish brown), and the reddish brown
  chrysalis. The latter, which is twice the natural size, is from a
  photograph by Mr. H. Main. The caterpillar feeds on the foliage of oak,
  birch, sallow, hawthorn, sloe, plum, larch, etc.; it grows very slowly,
  and may be beaten out in most of the months from July to October. The
  moth is out in May and June, and sometimes earlier. Pretty generally
  distributed over the British Isles, but not noted in the Orkneys or
  Shetlands. The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Feathered Thorn</b> (<i>Himera</i> (<i>Colotois</i>) <i>pennaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>A more or less typical but rather small male specimen is shown on
  Plate <a href="#plate114">114</a>, Fig. 4, but the ground colour is
  frequently more tawny in tint, and sometimes it is much paler inclining
  to yellowish; the cross lines may be either wider apart, or closer
  together, and the inner one is often clouded with blackish; sometimes
  both lines become almost bandlike; the submarginal, usually interrupted,
  line is occasionally well defined. The female, often browner than the
  specimen depicted (Fig. 5) is frequently tinged with purple, and
  occasionally with pink.</p>

  <p>The batch of eggs, as deposited, was photographed by Mr. Main. The egg
  is olive green with a ring of pale specks around the micropylar end. The
  caterpillar is slaty grey inclining to purplish, with a series of not
  clearly defined ochreous diamonds on the back and a row of ochreous dots
  on each side; the raised points on the last ring are tipped with reddish
  (Plate <a href="#plate116">116</a>). It feeds on oak, birch, poplar,
  sallow, apple, hawthorn, sloe, etc. April to June. The moth is out in
  October and November, but is seldom noticed in the daytime; at night, the
  males are frequently seen at gas and electric light. The species is
  generally common in woodlands, especially as caterpillars, over the
  southern half of England and Wales, and occurs more or less frequently
  over the rest of the country, also in Scotland to Moray, and in Ireland.
  <!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum" title="404.png"><a
  name="page280"></a>{280}</span></p>

<h5><b>Scalloped Oak</b> (<i>Crocallis elinguaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Fig. 6 on Plate <a href="#plate114">114</a> shows the usual form of
  this species, in which there are blackish dots on the outer margins of
  all the wings. Fig. 7 depicts a form with the ground colour paler, and
  the outer marginal dots absent (ab. <i>trapezaria</i>, Boisduval). The
  ground colour varies to almost whitish on the one hand and to reddish
  buff on the other; the cross lines on the fore wings are distinct as a
  rule, but may be faint, and occasionally are entirely missing; the
  central space between the lines is most often brownish, sometimes tawny,
  but not infrequently this area is but little darker than the general
  colour. The blackish discal spot on the hind wings varies in size and
  somewhat in shape, but this and also the line beyond, are sometimes
  absent. Porritt (<i>List of Yorkshire Lepidoptera</i>) mentions two
  gynandrous specimens. Eggs, pale grey, with darkish grey marking (Plate
  <a href="#plate116">116</a>, Fig. 2<i>b</i>). The caterpillar, of which
  two figures from coloured drawings by Mr. A. Sich are given on Plate <a
  href="#plate116">116</a>, Figs. 2, 2<i>a</i>, varies from ochreous grey
  to dark grey tinged with purple; the front rings are often paler above,
  and the back has diamond-shaped marks upon it; the elevation on the last
  ring is edged with black. It feeds on the leaves of most trees and bushes
  during the spring. The moth is out in July and August, sometimes earlier.
  A pretty generally distributed species throughout the British Isles, but
  so far it has not been noted from the Hebrides, Orkneys, or Shetland.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to East Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>Orange Moth</b> (<i>Angerona prunaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Typical males of this species are orange and the females pale
  ochreous, all the wings sprinkled or freckled with purplish grey. (Plate
  <a href="#plate117">117</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 7 &#x2640;.) Ab.
  <i>corylaria</i>, Thunberg (Figs. 2 &#x2642;, <!-- Page 281 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="405.png"><a name="page281"></a>{281}</span>8
  &#x2640;), is brownish on the basal and outer marginal areas of the fore
  wings, and nearly the whole of the hind wings. The typical ground colour
  appears on the fore wings as a central band, but as a rule this does not
  quite reach the inner margin. Ab. <i>pickettaria</i>, Prout, is a
  modification of the <i>corylaria</i> form, in which the typical ground
  appears on the front margin above the brownish basal patch, and also
  along the outer margin, thus narrowing the brownish border on that area;
  in one male specimen the right pair of wings were <i>corylaria</i> and
  the left pair <i>pickettaria</i>. Another modification has the basal and
  outer marginal areas "a nondescript grey shade in the male and a golden
  brown in the female" (ab. <i>pallidaria</i>, Prout). Ab.
  <i>spangbergi</i>, Lampa, is of the typical form, but is without the dark
  freckles. Other aberrations have been named, and at least one gynandrous
  specimen is known. The eggs, which are laid in June, hatch in about
  twelve days. The caterpillars feed slowly until September or October, and
  then hibernate; but it has been noted that when reared in confinement,
  and supplied with privet, they nibble the stems during the winter.
  Occasionally, a caterpillar will feed up and assume the moth state in the
  autumn, but the usual habit is to complete growth in the spring, enter
  the chrysalis state in May, and appear as moths about the end of that
  month, if in captivity, or in June and July in the open. Various food
  plants have been given, among which are hawthorn, sloe, plum, birch,
  lilac, privet, and honeysuckle. The caterpillar is figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate118">118</a>, Fig. 2.</p>

  <p>The male flies in the early evening, but the female not until later.
  The species frequents woods, and may be disturbed by day from among the
  bracken and other undergrowth. It is more or less common in many woods
  throughout the southern half of England, and its range extends northwards
  to Yorkshire. In Ireland, it has occurred locally in counties Waterford,
  Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Clare, and Galway. It has been <!-- Page 282
  --><span class="pagenum" title="406.png"><a
  name="page282"></a>{282}</span>recorded from the Isle of Arran, but not
  from the mainland of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the distribution spreads to Amurland, Corea, and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Swallow-tailed Moth</b> (<i>Ourapteryx sambucaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This conspicuous-looking insect (Plate <a href="#plate117">117</a>,
  Fig. 6) is frequently seen in gardens, lanes, and the outskirts of woods,
  pretty well all over England, Wales, and Ireland. In Scotland, it seems
  to be rare and confined to the south, but has been noted up to Glasgow.
  Very rarely the cross lines of the fore wings are placed close together,
  but, except in the matter of size, there is, as a rule, little
  variation.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, of which a figure, from a coloured drawing by Mr. A.
  Sich, is given on Plate <a href="#plate118">118</a>, Fig. 1, is brownish,
  variegated with reddish or purplish. It feeds, from August to June, on
  the foliage of hawthorn, sloe, elder, etc., but is especially partial to
  ivy.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July, and sometimes an odd specimen or two will
  appear in the autumn; one was captured at Gravesend on October 22,
  1904.</p>

  <p>The species is represented in Amurland and Japan by the smaller and
  whiter var. <i>persica</i>, Ménetries.</p>

<h5><b>Scorched Wing</b> (<i>Eurymene dolabraria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The crumpled or shrivelled appearance of the wings, coupled with the
  brown coloration of the streaks and other markings on the wings, no doubt
  suggested the English name of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate117">117</a>, Fig. 3).</p>

  <p>The twig-like caterpillar is brownish, tinged with greenish or
  reddish, and variegated with darker, especially along the back of the
  first three rings, the hump on ring 8, and a cross stripe on the last

  <p>The moth, which inhabits woods, and is out in late May and in June, is
  sometimes attracted to sugar, but rather more frequently to light. It is,
  however, far more rarely seen than the caterpillar, which has been
  obtained in almost every English county up to Yorkshire. A specimen of
  the moth has been recorded from Darlington, Durham, and one at Meldon
  Park, Northumberland. It occurs in Wales and Ireland, but is hardly known
  to be found in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>The Brimstone</b> (<i>Opisthograptis luteolata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This generally distributed and often common yellow species (Plate <a
  href="#plate117">117</a>, Figs. 4 and 5) has the front margin of the fore
  wings marked with reddish, and occasionally a stripe of this colour
  extends along the front margin from the base to the tip; the discal mark
  is whitish outlined in reddish brown; the wavy cross lines are often
  faint, and not infrequently quite absent. White specimens, ab.
  <i>lacticolor</i>, Harrison, have been recorded from Cheshire and Durham,
  and probably have occurred elsewhere, since I have a specimen said to
  have been taken in Staffordshire; an orange-yellow form has occurred in
  the last-named county. (Also known as <i>Rumia cratægata</i>.)</p>

  <p>The twig-like caterpillar is brownish tinged with greenish or
  purplish; there is a double-pointed hump on the back of ring 6 and
  smaller projections on 8. It feeds on hawthorn chiefly, but sometimes on
  sloe, plum, etc. It may be found after hibernation in the spring, and a
  second generation occurs in the summer.</p>

  <p>The moth seems to have been noted in each month from April to August,
  but it is most frequent in May and June. <!-- Page 284 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="410.png"><a name="page284"></a>{284}</span></p>

<h5><b>Bordered Beauty</b> (<i>Epione apiciaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The orange-yellow moth whose portrait is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate119">119</a> (Fig. 1) has the outer margins, beyond the
  second blackish line, more or less shaded with purplish grey, inclining
  to purple near the line; on the fore wings, the first cross line is
  angled at the middle, and the second line runs to the tips of the wings.
  Gynandrous specimens of this and also the following species have been
  noted.</p>

  <p>The early stages are figured on Plate <a href="#plate121">121</a>,
  Figs. 2, 2<i>a</i>. The eggs, which are laid in July and August on the
  food plant, are pale yellow at first, then reddish, with white dots and
  patches. The caterpillars generally emerge in the following spring, but
  sometimes, at least in captivity, they hatch in about a fortnight, feed
  up quickly, and attain the moth state in September or October.</p>

  <p>Caterpillar, brown, with a greenish or ochreous tinge; along the back
  of rings 3 to 6 is an ochreous patch, and within this a black mark, and
  on the rings following 6 there are more or less distinct ochreous
  diamonds; a dull yellowish line low down along the sides; head, dull
  reddish brown. It feeds, in May and June, on willow, sallow, alder, etc.
  The moth is out in July and August, and is not uncommon in many parts of
  Southern and Eastern England. Its range extends through England, Wales,
  and Scotland to Sutherland. In Ireland, it is widely distributed, and not
  at all scarce in some northern localities.</p>

<h5><b>Dark Bordered Beauty</b> (<i>Epione parallelaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>As will be seen on referring to Plate <a href="#plate119">119</a> the
  sexes of this species are strikingly different. The male (Fig. 2) is very
  similar to the last species, except that the first cross line is curved
  and reddish brown in colour; the second line runs to the front margin
  before the tip, and the outer margin beyond is almost entirely purple.
  The female (Fig. 3) has the ground colour pale yellowish, and the outer
  borders narrowed, especially on the fore wings. Very occasionally, the
  ground colour in the male approaches that of the female. The eggs (Plate
  <a href="#plate121">121</a>, Fig. 1) are pale yellow when deposited, but
  afterwards become honey yellow, freckled with reddish, and later they are
  red all over. The caterpillar is dingy brown, inclining to greyish on the
  back of the first four rings, a dark mark about the middle of the back,
  and on each side of this two slender whitish lines are fairly distinct;
  underside, whitish tinged with pale violet. It feeds, in May and June,
  sometimes later, on dwarf sallow and willow, birch, aspen, etc.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, sometimes later. Although odd
  specimens have been recorded from Norfolk, St. Ives (Hunts), Newbury
  (Berks), and Arundel (Sussex), the species is a northern one, occurring
  chiefly near York (Sanburn Moss).</p>

  <p>In 1863, two specimens were secured at Learmouth Bog, near
  Cornhill-on-Tweed, and in 1890, Bolam found it at Newham Bog, on the
  Northumberland border. Renton states that it is fairly common in good
  seasons at Adderstone-lea Moss, Roxburghshire; and Salvage found it
  widely distributed in Sutherlandshire.</p>

<h5><b>Little Thorn</b> (<i>Epione advenaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate119">119</a>, Fig. 4) is usually
  whitish, freckled and clouded with grey brown; cross lines rather darker.
  The markings may be tinged with ochreous, or with red (Sheffield).</p>

  <p>A uniform brown-coloured specimen with white fringes has been bred
  (Surrey).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greyish brown, minutely freckled with blackish; two
  white spots on front of ring 5, and two smaller <!-- Page 286 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="414.png"><a name="page286"></a>{286}</span>ones on
  11; the rings between 5 and 11 with pale diamonds on the back, and
  whitish marks on the sides; head, black, white dotted. It feeds, in July
  and August, or even later, on dogwood, bilberry, sallow, etc. Mr. A. J.
  Scollick, who kindly provided the caterpillar figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate121">121</a>, Fig. 3, informs me that in rearing larvæ from
  the egg he finds that they prefer dogwood as a pabulum, and that in the
  locality where he takes the moth in June there is no bilberry, but plenty
  of <i>Cornus sanguinea</i>. This local species, which is out from late
  May well into June, is generally associated with bilberry, but by no
  means confined to localities where this plant flourishes. In some of its
  haunts it affects bramble, and in others rose. It occurs, in woodlands,
  in Essex, Kent, Surrey (Leith Hill, Horsley, Chilworth, etc.), Berkshire,
  and Oxfordshire (near Watlington), Sussex (Abbots Wood, St. Leonards
  Forest, etc.), Hampshire (New Forest), Devonshire (Haldon), in the West
  to Shropshire, and South Wales; Derbyshire and South Yorks.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland, Corea, and Japan; thus it has a
  more eastern distribution than either of our other species of
  <i>Epione</i>, which only reach Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Speckled Yellow</b> (<i>Venilia maculata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This pretty blackish-spotted yellow species (Plate <a
  href="#plate119">119</a>, Figs. 5 and 6) varies somewhat in the tint of
  ground colour, but more so in the number and size of the markings;
  occasionally some of these are united, forming bands or blotches; or they
  may be reduced in number and size, leading up to ab.
  <i>quadrimaculata</i>, Hatchett (Pinion-spotted Yellow), a form that used
  to occur rarely in the Dartford district, Kent, and of which an example
  is depicted on Plate <a href="#plate61">61</a>, Fig. 2.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with white lines and stripes; head, shining
  green. It feeds, in July and August, on wood sage (<i>Teucrium</i>),
  woundwort (<i>Stachys</i>), and dead nettle (<i>Lamium</i>). <!-- Page
  287 --><span class="pagenum" title="415.png"><a
  name="page287"></a>{287}</span></p>

  <p>The moth is a lover of the woodlands, and as it flies in the daytime,
  especially when sunny, will be almost certainly noted on the wing by any
  one rambling through the woods in June, or even late May. It is generally
  plentiful in the south and west of England, but although its range
  extends through the northern parts of the country, and widely over
  Scotland to Sutherland, it is more or less local and often rare in the
  northern area indicated. In North Wales and South-west Ireland, it is
  local, but not uncommon.</p>

<h5><b>The Peacock Moth</b> (<i>Semiothisa</i> (<i>Macaria</i>) <i>notata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Whitish, with an ochreous tinge, and clouded with ochreous grey; three
  indistinct cross lines on the fore wings, commencing as brownish spots on
  the front margin; a larger brownish spot, inclining to reddish, on the
  front margin beyond the angle of outer line, and a large blackish or
  brownish divided spot below it; a shallow notch under the tips of the
  wings, edged with dark brown, and fringed with smoky brown. (Plate <a
  href="#plate119">119</a>, Fig. 7.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with brown markings on the sides, or
  brownish with green markings; head, black as a rule, but occasionally
  green. It feeds, in late June and in July, on birch and sallow; there is
  a second brood in August and September. The moth may be beaten out from
  birch bushes in May and June, and again in July and August. Woods are its
  favourite haunts, especially those where heather and small birch abound,
  but it is very local in the south of England, although it occurs in most
  of the counties from Kent to Cornwall. Barrett states that it is rather
  common in heathy woods in Staffordshire and Cheshire, and Forsythe gives
  it as local and uncommon in the Lancaster district; also recorded from
  Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Herts (Bentley Wood, 1901), and Gloucestershire;
  Glamorganshire, South Wales; Inverness and Ross, in Scotland. <!-- Page
  288 --><span class="pagenum" title="416.png"><a
  name="page288"></a>{288}</span></p>

<h5><b>Sharp-angled Peacock</b> (<i>Semiothisa alternata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Whitish clouded and suffused with greyish; fore wings crossed by three
  dark lines, commencing in blackish spots on the front margin; a greyish
  band follows the outer line, a reddish brown spot at the costal end, and
  a blackish spot about the middle, the spot broken up by the veins, which
  are here ochreous; a rather deep notch below the tip is edged with black
  and fringed with blackish. Hind wings with a black central dot, and a
  greyish band beyond. (Plate <a href="#plate119">119</a>, Fig. 8.)</p>

  <p>Mr. A. J. Scollick has recorded that some caterpillars, presumably
  about a week old on June 24, 1905, went into chrysalis July 7 to 12. One
  moth emerged July 18, but no other appeared until December 20. A third
  came up on January 5, 1906, and a fourth on February 5.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale green, with reddish brown blotches on the
  sides, and sometimes the back is also reddish brown. It feeds on alder,
  sallow, and sloe, in June, and as a second generation in the autumn.
  (Eggs and a caterpillar, the latter after Hofmann, are figured on Plate
  <a href="#plate123">123</a>.) The moth flies in May and early June, and
  occasionally in July or August.</p>

  <p>This species, which is always local, is perhaps most frequently met
  with in the New Forest, Hants, but it is not uncommon in some parts of
  the Isle of Wight, Dorset, Devon, and Kent. Also noted from a few other
  southern counties, and from Suffolk, Norfolk, and Westmoreland. In Wales,
  it has occurred at Neath, Glamorganshire.</p>

  <p>The range of this species abroad, and also that of the last, extends
  to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Tawny-barred Angle</b> (<i>Semiothisa liturata</i>).</h5>

  <p>The more frequent forms of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate119">119</a>, Figs. 9, 10. In some examples the cross lines
  are almost absent, but in others they are very distinct and blackish in
  colour; the orange yellow band in the outer marginal area varies in width
  and in strength, but it is usually present, even in the sooty brown form
  ab. <i>nigrofulvata</i>, Collins (Plate <a href="#plate61">61</a>, Fig.
  7), described from Delamere, Cheshire, also found in Shropshire, and
  recorded from "Oakley Wood."</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate123">123</a>, Fig. 2) is green,
  with white or creamy transverse lines and stripes; head, reddish. Another
  form is pale ochreous grey or brownish, with pale grey lines and stripes;
  head, almost black, with purple tinge. It feeds on the needles of Scots
  pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>), in July and August, and occasionally in
  September and October. A photograph of the chrysalis by Mr. H. Main,
  enlarged to twice natural size, is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate123">123</a>.</p>

  <p>The moth is to be found in fir woods, where it lurks among the
  branches or sits on the trunks, or on the fallen needles on the ground.
  The moths of the first generation appear in June and July and, where it
  occurs, the second flies in August and September. Widely distributed over
  the British Isles, but not noted north of Moray, in Scotland.</p>

<h5><b>Early Moth</b> (<i>Hybernia rupicapraria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Although generally common, and often abundant, over England, Wales,
  the south of Scotland, and Ireland, this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate120">120</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 3 &#x2640;) hardly ever comes
  under notice unless hedgerows and hawthorn bushes are examined in January
  and February, by the aid of a lantern, after darkness has set in. Then
  the males, and almost wingless females, will be found in numbers, sitting
  at the ends of the twigs.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is whitish green, clouded with darker green, striped
  with white along the back, and marked with white on the sides. The
  general colour is sometimes very dark green, approaching black, and in
  this form the white markings are <!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum" title="420.png"
  ><a name="page290"></a>{290}</span>more striking. It feeds, in April and
  May, on hawthorn, sloe, plum, and bilberry.</p>

<h5><b>Spring Usher</b> (<i>Hybernia leucophæaria</i>).</h5>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:23%;">
      <a href="images/fig09.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig09.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 9." title="Fig. 9." /></a>

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Spring Usher at rest.</b></p>

    <p style="text-align:center">(Photo by W. J. Lucas.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate120">120</a> are shown the typical and more
  usual forms of this variable species. Fig. 2 represents the male, and
  Fig. 4 the female. The form with blackish base and outer margin is ab.
  <i>marmorinaria</i>, Esper (Plate <a href="#plate120">120</a>, Fig. 5).
  Ab. <i>merularia</i>, Weymer, is entirely black, and a modification of
  this form is shown in Fig. 6. Between each of these extremes and the type
  there are various gradations.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is usually some shade of green, with yellowish lines
  on the back, and some have brownish marks on the sides; in others there
  are dark brown marks on the back of each ring. It feeds on the leaves of
  oak, in April and May.</p>

  <p>The moth rests on tree-trunks, fences, etc., and the males may be thus
  found during the day in February, earlier or later in some seasons; the
  female is less often obtained on trees and fences, but may be beaten,
  together with the male, from the dead leaves which remain upon oak and
  other bushes.</p>

  <p>The species appears to occur, more or less locally, in most of the
  English counties; it has also been recorded from Pembrokeshire and
  Flintshire, in Wales. In Scotland, it is obtained in <!-- Page 291
  --><span class="pagenum" title="421.png"><a
  name="page291"></a>{291}</span>the south, and northwards to
  Aberdeenshire. There are but two records from Ireland, and these are
  doubtful.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Scarce Umber</b> (<i>Hybernia aurantiaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>One specimen of each sex of this orange yellow species will be found
  on Plate <a href="#plate120">120</a>, where Fig. 7 represents the male,
  and Fig. 9 the female; the cross lines, in the male, are usually distinct
  on all the wings, but those on the hind pair are sometimes very faint,
  and occasionally absent. The ground colour is paler in some specimens
  than in others, and there is variation in the amount of purplish
  speckling, in the purplish clouding following the second line, and in the
  submarginal series of purplish marks of the fore wings. The marginal dots
  are sometimes absent from the hind wings, most frequently in specimens
  with faint cross lines on these wings.</p>

  <p>The eggs (Plate <a href="#plate125">125</a>, Fig. 2), when I received
  them in February, were purplish, or violet brown.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish, inclining to ochreous, lined with brown
  on the back, and striped with purplish on the sides; underside, dark
  purplish brown, inclining to blackish, and striped with yellowish. It
  feeds in the spring, sometimes to June, on oak, birch, blackthorn, etc.,
  and may be found on the leaves during the day. The moth is out in the
  latter part of the year, from October, and is best obtained at night,
  when sitting on the twigs of trees and bushes, but a specimen or two may
  be found on tree-trunks, palings, etc., in the daytime.</p>

  <p>The species is widely distributed over England, and in some parts it
  is common in woods; also occurs in Wales. In Scotland it is very rare and
  local in Roxburghshire; local and uncommon in the Clyde area, and has
  been recorded from other parts of the country up to Aberdeen. Rare in
  Ireland, but noted from <!-- Page 292 --><span class="pagenum" title="422.png"
  ><a name="page292"></a>{292}</span>Tyrone (local among birches at
  Cookstown), Monaghan, Fermanagh (Enniskillen), and Galway.</p>

<h5><b>Dotted Border</b> (<i>Hybernia marginaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate120">120</a> four specimens of this rather
  variable species are depicted. Figs. 8 &#x2642; and 10 &#x2640; show the
  more usual form; Fig. 12 represents the northern English, blackish var.
  <i>fuscata</i>, Harrison, and Fig. 11 an intermediate form resulting from
  a cross-pairing of <i>fuscata</i> &#x2640; with a southern &#x2642;.
  Somewhat similar forms to the last have been captured in Wear Dale,
  Durham.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is figured on Plate <a href="#plate125">125</a>, from
  a coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich. It is described by Fenn as dull
  yellow, olive green, or greenish brown; a series of dark grey X-like
  marks on the back, most distinct on rings 5-11; the spiracles are white,
  each placed in a black cloud, and the spaces between them paler,
  sometimes yellowish; the last ring is often brown without marking, and
  the front rings have a purplish stripe above; under surface, paler
  throughout. It feeds, in April and May, as a rule, but has been found
  later, on hawthorn, sloe, oak, birch, alder, sallow, etc., and may be
  obtained in the daytime.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in March and April; and after their short evening
  flight the males may be seen in numbers on hedgerows and the twigs of
  trees. It is not infrequent at sallow catkins, and sometimes is not
  scarce on palings and tree-trunks. The female may occasionally be
  detected in the crevices of bark on tree-trunks, but is more easily
  obtained on the twigs at night.</p>

  <p>The species is common over the whole of England and Wales, also in
  Ireland. As regards Scotland, it is abundant in the south, but its range
  does not seem to extend beyond Aberdeen; the var. <i>fuscata</i> occurs
  in Renfrewshire.</p>

<h5><b>Mottled Umber</b> (<i>Hybernia defoliaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>A female (Fig. 3) and four examples of the male of this variable
  species are shown on Plate <a href="#plate122">122</a>. The ground colour
  of the fore wings in the male varies from whitish, through ochreous brown
  to dull russet brown; the cross bands (when present) range in colour from
  reddish brown to dark purplish, almost blackish, brown; in all the paler
  specimens the ground colour is more or less sprinkled or suffused with
  brownish; the darker specimens are sprinkled with dark purplish or
  blackish. Ab. <i>obscurata</i>, Staud., is almost uniformly dull
  brownish, and an example approaching this form is represented by Fig.
  4.</p>

  <p>When deposited the eggs (Plate <a href="#plate125">125</a>, Fig.
  1<i>b</i>) were deep straw yellow. <!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum" title="426.png"
  ><a name="page294"></a>{294}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar (figured on Plate <a href="#plate125">125</a>, Fig. 1,
  from a coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich) has various shades of reddish
  brown on the back, and yellowish on the sides and beneath; the line above
  the red-marked white spiracles is black, and this has an interrupted
  edging of white. Fig. 1<i>a</i> shows a pale form. It feeds on the
  foliage of birch, oak, and other forest trees, also on fruit trees, rose,
  honeysuckle, etc. It often occurs in great abundance, and is largely
  responsible for the leafless condition of the trees, sometimes noticed in
  May.</p>

  <p>The moth appears from October to December, and occasionally in
  January, February, or March.</p>

  <p>Generally abundant throughout England and Wales; widely distributed,
  and often common in Ireland; not uncommon in the south of Scotland, but
  becoming less frequent northwards to Perthshire and Aberdeen.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">(Photo by H. Main.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The caterpillar is pale green with a rather darker line along the
  back, and yellowish lines along the sides. It feeds on hawthorn, sloe,
  privet, lilac, currant, plum, cherry, rose, etc., also on oak, hornbeam,
  and some other trees: April to June. The figure of the caterpillar on
  Plate <a href="#plate125">125</a>, Fig. 4, is from a coloured drawing by
  Mr. A. Sich.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in the spring, and may be found on palings,
  tree-trunks, etc., in the daytime, and more freely flying about, or
  sitting on hedges, at night, when the spider-like wingless female is more
  frequently obtained. The male is attracted by light, and sometimes is not
  uncommon on gas lamps.</p>

  <p>Except that it seems not to have been noted north of Perthshire in
  Scotland, the species is generally distributed over the British
  Isles.</p>

<h5><b>Pale Brindled Beauty</b> (<i>Phigalia pedaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate122">122</a>,
  Figs. 9 &#x2640;, 10, 11 &#x2642;) are greyish, tinged with greenish or
  brown, and sprinkled with darker grey or brownish; the irregular cross
  lines are blackish. Occasional specimens in the north of England are more
  or less sprinkled with yellow buff or orange buff, and in these the
  cross-markings may be present or absent. A more frequent form of
  aberration in the north is a general darkening of the colour in <!-- Page
  296 --><span class="pagenum" title="430.png"><a
  name="page296"></a>{296}</span>the direction of ab. <i>monacharia</i>,
  Staud., which is smoky black with the veins black, and occurs chiefly in
  South Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, figured on Plate <a href="#plate126">126</a>, Fig. 1,
  from a coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich, is dull reddish brown, relieved
  with rust red mottling; the notched head is greyish brown. It feeds, in
  the spring, on birch, oak, elm, lime, poplar, sallow, hawthorn, sloe,
  plum and other fruit trees, rose, etc.</p>

  <p>The moth is out as a rule during the first two or three months of the
  year, but it has been noted in November and December, and also in
  mid-June. It may be seen in the daytime on tree-trunks, palings, etc.,
  but the female secretes herself in any convenient cranny, and is not
  easily detected. The male flies at night, and comes freely to light.</p>

  <p>The species is pretty generally distributed throughout England and
  Wales, and Scotland up to Aberdeen. In Ireland, it has a wide
  distribution, but Kane states that, except in the Belfast district, it is
  decidedly scarce in the country.</p>

<h5><b>Small Brindled Beauty</b> (<i>Apocheima hispidaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>In the male (Plate <a href="#plate124">124</a>, Figs. 1 and 2) the
  fore wings are ochreous grey inclining to brownish, usually much paler on
  the outer margin; cross lines black. Hind wings, greyish white, with a
  blackish central band. Fringes of all the wings chequered with blackish.
  Often the central area of the fore wings, between the first and second
  lines, is more or less blackish; less frequently the whole of these
  wings, up to or just beyond the submarginal line, is blackish; and
  sometimes the pale outer marginal area is broken up by the blackish
  nervules. Very rarely, the ground colour is almost white, and the
  cross-markings on the fore wings dusky grey. The female (Plate <a
  href="#plate124">124</a>, Fig. 3) varies from brown to blackish. <!--

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Small Brindled Beauty at rest.</b></p>

    <p style="text-align:center">(Photo by H. Main.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The caterpillar is brown, inclining to blackish or purplish, the
  raised spots are black, and occasionally the sides are freckled with
  orange (Plate <a href="#plate126">126</a>, Fig. 2, from a coloured
  drawing by Mr. A. Sich). It feeds in May and early June on oak, and will
  also eat hawthorn, birch, and elm.</p>

  <p>The moth, which is out in February and March, appears to be local, but
  has a wide distribution through England from Durham to Hampshire, and
  even Devonshire. It has also been recorded from Denbighshire, North
  Wales. A well-known locality is Richmond Park, in Surrey, and here it is
  found resting on oak trunks or on the grass stems, etc., under or around
  the trees. The male is attracted by light.</p>

<h5><b>Rannoch Brindled Beauty</b> (<i>Nyssia lapponaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The sexes of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate134">134</a>, where Fig. 3 represents the male, and Fig. 5
  the female. It was not known to occur in the British Isles until 1871,
  when a male specimen was captured in Perthshire, on April 20 of that
  year. Mr. William M. Christy, in 1895, bred some moths from larvæ
  obtained in the Highlands of Scotland, and he sent eggs to Mr. F. W.
  Frohawk, who worked out the life history, and described and figured all
  the stages from egg to perfect insect (<i>Entom.</i> xxviii. 237). In
  July, 1900 and 1901, Mr. E. A. Cockayne found <!-- Page 298 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="432.png"><a
  name="page298"></a>{298}</span>caterpillars, in Perthshire (Rannoch
  district), on ling, heath, and bog-myrtle; and in June, 1904, he
  published (<i>Entom.</i> xxxvii. 149) some interesting observations on
  the habits of the species in its native haunts. The greenish yellow eggs
  are laid in batches of 10 to 150 in the dry corollas of the cross-leaved
  heath, and less frequently between the stem and sheath of reeds, or in
  cracks in dead bracken stems, etc. The caterpillar (Plate <a
  href="#plate126">126</a>, Fig. 3) is pale drab, inclining to a yellowish
  tint; irregular yellow stripes along the back and sides, and lines of
  blackish streaks between the stripes. It will eat birch, sallow, and
  hawthorn, in captivity; but in the open it feeds on heather and
  bog-myrtle: May-July. The chrysalis is reddish brown, rather paler on the
  wing covers (figured on Plate <a href="#plate126">126</a> from a photo,
  twice natural size, by Mr. H. Main). The moth is out in April and May,
  and sits on the twigs of heather and the stems of bog-myrtle. It has only
  been recorded from Perthshire, and is there very local, frequenting damp
  places near streams.</p>

  <p>Mr. A. W. Mera has obtained hybrids from a crossing of this species
  with <i>N. zonaria</i>.</p>

<h5><b>Belted Beauty</b> (<i>Nyssia zonaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two males and a female of this species are depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate124">124</a> (Figs. 4, 5 &#x2642;, 6 &#x2640;). There is
  variation in the ground colour of the male, from white to greyish, and
  the markings are sometimes greyish brown and sometimes blackish. Kane
  states that, in Ireland, a large number of Connemara specimens have the
  fore wings entirely white, broken by dark veins, front margin, and three
  streaks parallel to the outer margin. The caterpillar is greenish, with
  dusky grey lines and freckles on the back, and a yellow stripe low down
  along the sides; the latter is edged below with blackish; the underside
  is black and striped with grey; head, greyish, freckled with darker. It
  feeds on sallow, dandelion, dock, plantain, clover, yarrow, grass, etc.:
  May to August. (Plate <a href="#plate126">126</a>, Fig. 4; chrysalis,
  Fig. 4<i>a</i>; eggs, Plate <a href="#plate133">133</a>, Fig. 4.) The
  moth is out in March and April, and rests by day on or among herbage. The
  male has been known to fly in the sunshine, but its more usual time of
  flight is the early evening.</p>

  <p>The species is locally common on sand hills, on the coast of Cheshire,
  Flintshire, and Carnarvon; Wallasey is a noted locality, and the earliest
  British specimens were taken in that district about 1832; it also occurs
  on the Lancashire coast, in the Liverpool and Blackpool districts. In
  Ireland, it was first noted in Co. Antrim, where caterpillars were found
  at Ballycastle, and about twenty-two years ago moths were captured at the
  same place. Other Irish localities are Achill Island, off the coast of
  Mayo; Slyne Head and Roundstone, Connemara coast. There are records of
  its occurrence in the Isles of Skye and Tiree.</p>

<h5><b>Brindled Beauty</b> (<i>Lycia hirtaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>A male and a female are shown on Plate <a href="#plate124">124</a>
  (Figs. 7 &#x2642;, 8 &#x2640;), and these represent the more usual form
  of the sexes in the London district. Some specimens are paler, others are
  darker; and not infrequently the wings are sprinkled with yellowish.</p>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate1">1</a> (Figs. 4, 6, 8) will be found figures
  of a female and two male examples of a large race taken by Mr. H.
  McArthur this season (1908) at Aviemore, in Scotland. One of these males
  is of a remarkable ochreous coloration, whilst in the other the contrast
  of grey ground and black marking is equally striking. The female is
  blackish sprinkled with ochreous.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is purplish grey or reddish brown clouded and freckled
  with darker, and spotted with yellow on rings 5-8; the first ring is also
  marked with yellow in front, the head is freckled with black, and about
  the jaws with yellow. It feeds on lime, elm, willow, and fruit trees,
  especially plum and pear, <!-- Page 300 --><span class="pagenum" title="436.png"
  ><a name="page300"></a>{300}</span>in May, June, and July. For the
  example figured on Plate <a href="#plate128">128</a>, Fig. 1, I am
  indebted to Mr. Norman Riley; an Aviemore example is shown in colour on
  Plate <a href="#plate1">1</a>, Fig. 7. The chrysalis (Plate <a
  href="#plate128">128</a>, Fig. 1<i>a</i>) is dark reddish brown inclining
  to blackish. The moth comes out in March and April and is often a common
  object on tree-trunks, etc., in the London parks, squares, and gardens.
  Its range extends over the south of England, and northwards to Yorkshire
  and Cumberland, but it is nowhere so plentiful in England as throughout
  the Metropolitan area. It occurs in Wales, in Ireland, and in Scotland up
  to Inverness.</p>

<h5><b>Oak Beauty</b> (<i>Pachys</i> (<i>Amphidasys</i>) <i>strataria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate127">127</a>,
  Figs. 1-3) are white, sprinkled and cross lined with black; the first
  line is bordered inwardly, and the second line outwardly with brownish;
  frequently these two lines fall closely together on the inner margin, and
  sometimes they are united by a blackish blotch at this point; the
  brownish borders of the lines vary in width, and in some specimens the
  outer area beyond the second black line is almost entirely brownish; in
  other specimens the central and outer areas are almost free of black
  speckling, and in such examples the brownish borders of the lines stand
  out conspicuously. The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate128">128</a>,
  Fig. 2) is usually some shade of brown&mdash;greyish, violet, or
  purplish&mdash;mottled and freckled with a darker hue. It feeds on oak,
  birch, and elm, will also eat sloe, plum, rose, etc., and is found from
  May to July. In confinement, larvæ hatched in early May have gone down to
  pupate during the second week in June.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in March and April as a rule, but has been noted in
  late February, and also in early May. It may be seen resting during the
  day on trunks of trees, palings, etc., generally near the ground; when on
  the wing at night the male will come to light. Although not generally
  common it is widely distributed over England and Wales. In Ireland it has
  occurred in Wicklow, Westmeath, and Cork, and has been reared from pupæ
  obtained at Glenmalure in the former county.</p>

  <p>Hybrids resulting from a cross between <i>strataria</i> &#x2642; and
  <i>betularia</i> &#x2640; have been named <i>herefordi</i>, Tutt.</p>

<h5><b>Peppered Moth</b> (<i>Pachys betularia</i>).</h5>

  <p>Typically (Plate <a href="#plate129">129</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 3
  &#x2640;) the wings are white, "peppered" with black, and with more or
  less distinct cross lines, also black. The black speckling varies in
  amount, in some examples it is almost absent, whilst in others it is so
  dense that the wings appear to be black sprinkled with white. Specimens
  of the last form are intermediate between the type and the melanic ab.
  <i>doubledayaria</i>, Millière (Fig. 2). This black form, which seems to
  have been unknown about sixty years ago, is now much commoner than the
  type in the South-west Riding of Yorkshire, and has spread into
  Lancashire, Cheshire, and southwards to Lincolnshire. On the wolds of the
  latter county, and on Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, it is said to be the
  dominant form of the species. The aberration also occurs in the eastern
  and the southern counties of England to Hampshire. Northwards, the form
  has extended to Clydesdale in Scotland, where one was reared from a
  caterpillar obtained near Paisley. In Wales <i>doubledayaria</i> is in
  the ascendant at Newport, Monmouth, and in Ireland one example of this
  variety together with some intermediate and typical specimens were reared
  from caterpillars collected at Castle Bellingham, Co. Louth. Possibly the
  liberal distribution of the eggs of <i>doubledayaria</i> may have had
  something to do with the comparatively rapid extension of this form, at
  least to districts far away from its original locality.</p>

  <p>What is known as the buff var. of this species dates back to <!-- Page
  302 --><span class="pagenum" title="440.png"><a
  name="page302"></a>{302}</span>the year 1874, when a buff female, paired
  with a black male, was captured at Heaton Park. From the eggs she
  deposited caterpillars hatched, and in due course pupated, but the moths
  reared from them were all either typical, or black. Some of the female
  moths were, however, given to other collectors to pair with black males
  with the result that buff specimens appeared among the moths reared by
  seven collectors. Subsequently, by breeding only from buff males and
  females 80 per cent. of this form were said to be obtained. By the year
  1880, however, the race was extinct. In all the examples of the buff var.
  that I have seen, including a pair in my own collection, the ground
  colour is normal, but the usual black markings of the wings are brownish
  buff; I understand, however, that there are specimens in which the ground
  colour is ochreous. The vapour of chlorine will change an ordinary
  specimen to a buff var.; and it is said that caterpillars reared in an
  apartment where this vapour is present will produce these buff varieties.
  Mr. Mansbridge has recently described ab. <i>ochrearia</i>, and in this
  form the typical black markings are present on an ochreous ground. The
  specimen, a female, was captured at St. Annes, Lancashire, June,
  1891.</p>

  <p>Gynandrous examples have been obtained, and seven of these abnormal
  forms occurred in a single brood reared from eggs by Mr. A. Harrison.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate128">128</a>, Fig. 3, from a
  photo by Mr. H. Main) is green, brownish green, or purplish brown; in the
  green form, which is minutely dotted with white, there is generally a
  faint purplish line along the back, two purplish knobs on ring 8, and a
  purplish patch enclosing two ochreous spots on ring 11; the deeply
  notched head is ochreous, shaded with purplish; the last ring of the body
  is tinged with purplish, as also are the two small points thereon. It
  feeds, from July to September, on oak, birch, elm, beech, sallow, plum
  and other fruit trees; also on rose, bramble, etc. The moth is out in May
  and June, <!-- Page 303 --><span class="pagenum" title="441.png"><a
  name="page303"></a>{303}</span>sometimes in July. The species is
  generally distributed, and sometimes common in the caterpillar state, but
  seems to be absent from the Scottish Isles.</p>

<h5><b>Waved Umber</b> (<i>Hemerophila</i> (<i>Synopsia</i>) <i>abruptaria</i>).</h5>

  <div class="figright" style="width:22%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Waved Umber at rest.</b></p>

    <p style="text-align:center">(Photo by W. J. Lucas.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>A male and a female specimen are figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate130">130</a>. The males are usually darker than the females,
  but they vary in the amount of darker clouding and suffusion. Three forms
  of the species have been named as follows&mdash;ab. <i>brunneata</i>,
  Tutt, a modification of the female rather more strongly coloured than the
  darkest typical male. Ab. <i>fuscata</i>, Tutt, sooty brown, tending to
  blackish; both sexes somewhat paler in central area of fore wings. Ab.
  <i>unicolor</i>, Tutt, similar to ab. <i>fuscata</i>, but without pale
  marking; the thorax is also darker. (Plate <a href="#plate134">134</a>,
  Fig. 7, ab. <i>fuscata</i>.) The eggs, furnished by Mr. Norman Riley,
  were verdigris green when laid, but on the third day changed to
  greyish.</p>

  <p>In general colour the caterpillar is greyish brown sometimes tinged
  with green; pinkish brown blotches along the back, often united on the
  front and hind rings. In some cases the caterpillar is almost black, with
  a lighter mark on front of the first ring. It feeds on privet and lilac,
  and is said to eat currant, broom, and jasmine: May to August. (Plate <a
  href="#plate133">133</a>, Fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>The moth is out in April and May, and is fond of resting on palings,
  trees, and even walls. It appears to be most plentiful <!-- Page 304
  --><span class="pagenum" title="442.png"><a
  name="page304"></a>{304}</span>in the London district, in the north and
  east of which the dark forms occur; but it is found more or less
  frequently over the greater part of England, and in South Wales; single
  specimens were taken at Hartlepool, Durham, in 1874 and 1875. One example
  has been recorded from Kincardineshire, Scotland; and one from
  Enniskillen, Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Ringed Carpet</b> (<i>Boarmia cinctaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two specimens are shown on Plate <a href="#plate130">130</a>. Fig. 3
  represents the more or less typical form, and Fig. 4 depicts an example
  in which the central area is almost free of dark speckling, so that the
  whitish ground colour comes out distinctly. There is a good range of
  variation in the direction of both darker and paler forms than those
  figured. In some specimens with a clear white central area, the basal and
  outer marginal areas of the fore wings, and the outer area of the hind
  wings, are black or blackish; similar aberration is sometimes found in
  the more speckled specimens also. Occasionally, there is a projection
  from below the middle of the second black line to the basal band.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with darker green and whitish lines along
  the back and sides. It feeds on birch, sallow, and heath (<i>Erica
  cinerea</i>), and may be reared on knot-grass. The moth is out in May,
  sometimes late April or early June. The New Forest in Hampshire is the
  district <i>par excellence</i> for this species, the most favoured
  locality being the heathy tract near Lyndhurst, where the moths are very
  common, in some years, on tree-trunks, especially birch, and on heather.
  Other localities in England are Poole Heath, Parley Heath, and Bloxworth
  in Dorset; Tilgate Forest, etc., in Sussex; Reading district in Berks,
  first noted in 1891. In Ireland, it is widely distributed, and is
  abundant at Killarney and some other parts of Kerry.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Willow Beauty</b> (<i>Boarmia gemmaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The two portraits on Plate <a href="#plate130">130</a> represent the
  best known forms of this species. Stephens in 1831 referred the smoky or
  dark slaty grey form (Fig. 6), which is the ordinary one in the London
  district, now as then, to <i>rhomboidaria</i>. Newman subsequently named
  this form <i>perfumaria</i>, and he, and other entomologists of the time,
  considered it as a species distinct from <i>gemmaria</i> =
  <i>rhomboidaria</i>. We now know that the smoky grey specimens are not
  peculiar to the metropolitan area, but occur in other parts of England
  (Warwickshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire, etc.), and are found, with the
  type, at Howth and other localities in Ireland. The more general forms
  throughout England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland up to Perthshire, are
  pale brown, or greyish brown (typical), sometimes ochreous tinged (Fig.
  5); the latter is referable to ab. <i>consobrinaria</i>, Haworth. Black
  forms have been recorded from Norwich in Norfolk, and blackish specimens
  have been noted from Ashdown Forest, Sussex; from Cannock Chase,
  Staffordshire; and from the south of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The eggs (Plate <a href="#plate131">131</a>, Fig. 1<i>a</i>) are green
  at first, changing to pink mottled with green, and finally to dark grey;
  the latter change indicates early hatching of the caterpillar, which
  usually occurs about a fortnight after the eggs are deposited.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate131">131</a>, Fig. 1, after a
  coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich) is dull reddish brown, mottled more or
  less with ochreous; traces of diamond-shaped marks on the back, the
  latter sometimes well defined. It feeds on ivy (in London gardens
  especially), hawthorn, birch, privet, lilac, rose, clematis, broom, and
  many other shrubs, and also on yew and fir, in August, and after
  hibernation in the spring. The moth is out in July and August; sometimes
  a second brood occurs in September. <!-- Page 306 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="446.png"><a name="page306"></a>{306}</span></p>

  <p>This species is the <i>gemmaria</i> of Brahm (1791), but
  <i>rhomboidaria</i>, Schiffermüller (1776), although only a catalogue
  name until figured by Hübner, about 1797, is adopted by some authors.</p>

<h5><b>Satin Carpet</b> (<i>Boarmia abietaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>As an inhabitant of Britain this species was first noted from
  Hampshire, and in 1825 was figured and described by Curtis as <i>Alcis
  sericearia</i>. Two specimens of this form, from the New Forest, are
  depicted on Plate <a href="#plate132">132</a>, Figs. 1, 2; but paler, and
  also darker, examples are found in this locality, and, occasionally,
  melanic specimens occur as well. The latter form, some examples of which
  might be described as sooty black with black veins, is more prevalent
  among the yews and firs of Surrey.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, for the example of which (and also the egg), figured
  on Plate <a href="#plate138">138</a>, Figs. 1, 1<i>a</i>, I am obliged to
  Mr. Arthur J. Scollick, is, in one form, ochreous brown with paler
  cream-coloured patches on the back; and in another dark grey-brown with
  paler patches, sometimes of a light cinnamon brown; a pale, thin line
  along the middle of the back runs through a series of brownish diamonds;
  there are other pale lines on the back and sides, and these are edged
  with brownish, and partly with blackish; spiracles outlined in black.
  (Adapted from Buckler.) It feeds on spruce, pine, yew, oak, birch,
  sallow, etc., from August to June. A larva has been found on bilberry in
  Devon.</p>

  <p>The moth is out from late June to early August, but captured specimens
  are not often suitable for the cabinet, they are generally more or less
  frayed or scarred.</p>

  <p>Beside Surrey and Hants, previously mentioned, the species occurs in
  Sussex (Tilgate Forest), Buckinghamshire (Halton), and has been recorded
  from Berkshire; Egg Buckland, Oxton, Bickleigh Vale, and other Devonshire
  localities; also from Cornwall, Somersetshire, Gloucestershire (the
  Cotswolds), and Monmouthshire.</p>

  <p>Staudinger and other recent authors have adopted <i>ribeata</i>,
  Clerck, for this species.</p>

<h5><b>Mottled Beauty</b> (<i>Boarmia repandata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two examples of the more ordinary mottled form of this species are
  shown on Plate <a href="#plate132">132</a>, Figs. 3 &#x2642;, and 4
  &#x2640;. Fig. 6 represents ab. <i>destrigaria</i>, Haworth
  (<i>muraria</i>, Curtis); and Fig. 5 depicts a specimen near var.
  <i>sodorensium</i>, Weir, from the Isle of Lewis. Dark-brown forms,
  inclining to blackish, are not uncommon in the London district, but in
  South Yorkshire coal-black specimens with whitish submarginal lines
  occur; a sooty black example from the Sheffield district is figured on
  Plate <a href="#plate134">134</a>, Fig. 4, and, it may be added, these
  melanic forms are referable to ab. <i>nigricata</i>, Fuchs.</p>

  <p>Two forms of ab. <i>conversaria</i>, Hübner, will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate134">134</a>, where Fig. 1 depicts a specimen from the New
  Forest, and Fig. 8 represents an extreme example from North Devon. The
  <i>conversaria</i> form occurs chiefly in the south and west of England,
  and is perhaps most plentiful along the North Devon coast; also in South
  Wales; Durham (rarely, on the coast). Broad dark banded specimens are
  recorded from Arran and Argyll.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (figured on Plate <a href="#plate131">131</a>, Fig. 2,
  after Sich) is brownish inclining to ochreous; a dark brownish line along
  the middle of the back, and a series of brownish diamond-shaped marks
  most distinct on the back of the middle rings; a line of blackish marks
  along the sides shows up in the paler examples. Sometimes the general
  colour is dark reddish brown, freckled with dark brown; but in all cases
  the underside is paler than the upper, and is striped and lined with dark
  and pale brown. <!-- Page 308 --><span class="pagenum" title="450.png"><a
  name="page308"></a>{308}</span>It feeds on hawthorn, birch, elm, hazel,
  bilberry, heather, etc., from July to May.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, and specimens of a second generation
  have been reared in September. Generally common throughout the British
  Isles.</p>

<h5><b>Great Oak Beauty</b> (<i>Boarmia roboraria</i>).</h5>

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Caterpillar of Great Oak
    Beauty.</b></p>

    <p style="text-align:center">(Photo by "A. Forester".)</p>
  </div>

  <p>The fine Boarmid moth shown on Plate <a href="#plate135">135</a>, Fig.
  2, has all the typical markings well defined. Occasionally the black
  cross lines are more distinct, but sometimes they are more or less
  absent, or obscured. An almost black specimen is mentioned by Barrett as
  taken in the Reading district, Berkshire; and the same author states that
  a black example was captured in the Midlands about the year 1887, but no
  other specimen was observed until 1893, when a female was obtained, and
  from eggs deposited smoky black moths were reared.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is very like an oak twig in shape, especially when in
  repose. (See Fig. 18.) In colour it is reddish brown, inclining to
  ochreous brown; brownish grey on the humps on rings 5 and 11, and on the
  skin folds. It feeds on oak during the autumn, and, after hibernation, in
  the spring. The moth is out in June and July, and may be found on oak
  trees rather high up the trunks. When on the wing at night it will visit
  the sugar patch.</p>

  <p>The species occurs most frequently in the New Forest, Hampshire,
  where, in some years, it is very common. Other English counties in which
  it has been found, or still exists, are&mdash;Devon (Cann Woods), Dorset
  (Cranborne and Bloxworth), Wilts. (Savernake Forest), Sussex (Abbots
  Wood, Charlton Forest, Holme Bank, etc.), Surrey (Addington, June, 1902),
  Kent, Essex (Epping Forest), Berks., Bucks., Warwick (Princethorpe Wood),
  Worcester (Wyre Forest), Stafford (Cannock Chase), Cheshire (Dunham
  Park), York (wood near Selby), Lancashire (Corporation and Quernmore
  Woods).</p>

<h5><b>Pale Oak Beauty</b> (<i>Boarmia consortaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Some specimens are rather greyer, and the cross markings are
  occasionally less distinct than in Figs. 1 &#x2642;, and 3 &#x2640; on
  Plate <a href="#plate135">135</a>, which represent the typical forms of
  this species in England. Examples of a blackish form have been noted from
  a wood in West Kent, and these are apparently referable to the melanic
  ab. <i>humperti</i>, Humpert, but the Kentish specimens I have seen had
  the second line of fore wings edged with white, and a white submarginal
  line.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which in shape is somewhat like that of the last
  species, varies in colour. One form is greenish grey, with three lines,
  the central one darker than those on each side. In another the colour is
  pale brown mottled with reddish and a darker brown. It feeds on oak,
  birch, and sometimes sallow, in July and August.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, and specimens have been recorded as
  captured in September. It may be found on the trunks of oak and fir
  trees, and will come to sugar and light at night. Although local it is
  not uncommon in the New Forest and other woods in Hampshire; also in
  Sussex, Surrey, Kent. <!-- Page 310 --><span class="pagenum" title="454.png"
  ><a name="page310"></a>{310}</span>and Berkshire. It has been recorded
  from Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire, and Dorsetshire; and as local and scarce
  in the Lancaster district.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan, and in both countries
  it is represented by var. <i>conferenda</i>, Butler.</p>

<h5><b>Speckled Beauty</b> (<i>Cleora angularia</i>).</h5>

  <p>Stephens, who in 1831 figured this insect as <i>Cleora viduaria</i>,
  Wien. Verz., remarks, "All the examples I have seen of this beautiful
  species were captured in the New Forest: the first about June, 1822, the
  remainder in 1825 and 1826: I believe in the vicinity of Lyndhurst."
  Barrett states that the late Mr. Samuel Stevens obtained a number of
  specimens "by sweeping the upper branches of oak trees in the New Forest
  with a long pole." This was in 1849; and between that year and 1872,
  about which time it seems to have disappeared, the moth was found, by
  those who knew where to look for it, in the Forest between Brockenhurst
  and Lyndhurst. Specimens have also been taken, in the past, in Tilgate
  Forest, Sussex, by the late William Tester, and by Mr. Merrifield, at
  Holm Bank, near Henfield, in the same county. There have been recent
  rumours of its reappearance in the New Forest, but I have been unable to
  ascertain anything definite about this. The specimen depicted in Plate <a
  href="#plate134">134</a>, Fig. 2, has been kindly lent by Mr. R.
  Adkin.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, stated by Hofmann to feed on lichen growing upon oak
  and birch, is brownish variegated with paler shades.</p>

<h5><b>Brussels Lace</b> (<i>Cleora lichenaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The greenish grey species shown on Plate <a href="#plate136">136</a>,
  Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;, varies in tint; the fore wings are often
  clouded with olive, and occasionally with blackish; there is frequently a
  tinge of <!-- Page 311 --><span class="pagenum" title="455.png"><a
  name="page311"></a>{311}</span>ochreous between the black cross lines,
  but sometimes this area is flushed with orange.</p>

  <p>Two figures of the caterpillar will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate133">133</a>, Fig. 2. In colour and marking it so closely
  resembles the greenish-grey lichen upon which it feeds, that its
  detection thereon is not always easy. May and June are the best months in
  which to collect the caterpillars (although they may be found during the
  autumn and early spring), and they may then be jarred from the lichen
  (<i>Usnea barbata</i>), etc., growing on branches of trees and bushes, or
  searched for among the lichen on the tree trunks, or on wooden pales and
  fences.</p>

  <p>The species is widely spread over the southern half of England, but is
  more or less rare from the Midlands northwards. It has occurred in South
  Wales; and Kane states that it is widely distributed and locally common
  in Ireland. In some parts of South Scotland it is not uncommon, and its
  range extends to Aberdeen and Ross.</p>

<h5><b>The Dotted Carpet</b> (<i>Cleora jubata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate136">136</a>, Figs. 3, 4) has long
  been known as <i>glabraria</i>, Hübner, but as authorities are agreed
  that <i>jubata</i>, Thunberg, is an earlier name, it must be adopted. The
  general colour is whitish, powdered with dark grey and black; there are
  four black spots on the front margin and from these blackish markings
  cross the wings, but only the first line is generally distinct, although
  a second line, beyond the large black discal spot, is sometimes clearly
  defined and entire; occasionally a central shade and a submarginal line
  are both in evidence. The hind wings have a black central spot and a
  blackish line beyond, but the latter is often absent. Exceptional
  aberration takes the form of leaden black blotches, clouds, and streaks
  on the fore wings, and dusky clouding on the hind wings, chiefly on the
  basal area. <!-- Page 312 --><span class="pagenum" title="456.png"><a
  name="page312"></a>{312}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar is of a faint bluish green, inclining to greenish
  white on the back; a row of black spots along the back, and a broken
  black narrow stripe along each side. It feeds on tree lichens (<i>Usnea
  barbata</i>), etc., from September to June or July. Three figures of this
  caterpillar are given on Plate <a href="#plate133">133</a>, Fig. 3.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, and may be found at rest on tree
  trunks now and then, but is more frequently obtained by jarring the
  lichen-clad branches of oak. Although it is known to occur very locally
  and somewhat rarely in the counties of Wilts., Dorset, and Devon, the New
  Forest in Hampshire is the English district where one is most likely to
  meet with this species. It has been recorded from Cornwall (Falmouth
  district, 1904), Hereford, Pembrokeshire, Carnarvonshire (Beddgelert),
  and Cumberland. Charlton Forest, Sussex, has also been mentioned. In
  Scotland, Renton states that it is generally common in Roxburghshire; it
  occurs in several of the woods in Clydesdale, and has been noted from
  Argyllshire.</p>

<h5><b>The Engrailed</b> (<i>Tephrosia bistortata</i>).</h5>

  <p>In the following brief remarks on <i>T. bistortata</i>, Goeze (=
  <i>biundularia</i>, Borkhausen), I have included reference to
  <i>crepuscularia</i>, Hübner (= <i>biundularia</i>, Esper). The former
  (which is also named <i>abietaria</i>, Haworth, and <i>laricaria</i>,
  Doubleday) appears on the wing in March and April, and there is a second
  flight in July and August. Moths of the second generation are few in
  number and small in size, and are referable to abs. <i>consonaria</i> and
  <i>strigularia</i>, Stephens. A third generation of still smaller moths
  has been reared. <i>Crepuscularia</i> is out in May and June, rarely in
  April; its caterpillar feeds in June and July or later; according to
  Barrett, a second generation of the moth has occurred in August. One or
  two moths have been captured in September or October, but whether these
  were referable to <i>bistortata</i> or <i>crepuscularia</i> is not quite
  clear.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:29%;">

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Small Engrailed, at rest.</b></p>

    <p style="text-align:center">(Photo by W. J. Lucas.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>By some authorities the double-brooded <i>bistortata</i> is <!-- Page
  313 --><span class="pagenum" title="457.png"><a
  name="page313"></a>{313}</span>considered specifically distinct from the,
  normally, single-brooded <i>crepuscularia</i>; others hold the opposite
  view. The March and April moths are generally rather browner in colour
  than those appearing in May and June, but I have some specimens taken in
  Wiltshire at the end of March, which are quite as pale as any example in
  the May-June series. Probably, we should be right in regarding
  <i>crepuscularia</i> as the older stock from which the double-brooded
  race, <i>bistortata</i>, has sprung. The former has a more extensive
  range, as it inhabits Northern Europe (Sutherlandshire in British Isles),
  whilst <i>bistortata</i> seems to be confined to Central Europe. A
  Perthshire form of the May-June race is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate136">136</a>, Fig. 7; and an example of ab.
  <i>delamerensis</i>, White, from Delamere Forest, Cheshire, is
  represented by Fig. 8. Figs. 6 &#x2642;, 7 &#x2640;, represent examples
  of the March and April race. Black or blackish forms, with the
  sub-marginal line more or less distinctly white, occur in both races,
  chiefly in Glamorganshire, South Wales.</p>

<p><!-- Page 314 --><span class="pagenum" title="458.png"><a name="page314"></a>{314}</span></p>

  <p>A photograph, by Mr. H. Main, of the caterpillar, is reproduced on
  Plate <a href="#plate138">138</a>, Fig. 3. The general colour is grey,
  inclining to yellowish or brownish; sometimes it is reddish brown; two
  broken dark-grey lines on the back, and some pale blotches on the sides.
  The caterpillars of the first race (<i>bistortata</i>) feed in May and
  June, and again in August and September. Those of the second race in June
  and July, or later. They seem to eat the foliage of trees, including
  those in orchards.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;Cross-pairings between
  <i>bistortata</i> &#x2642; and <i>crepuscularia</i> &#x2640; resulted in
  the ab. <i>ridingi</i>, Tutt, whilst the offspring of a crossing of
  <i>crepuscularia</i> &#x2642; and <i>bistortata</i> &#x2640; have been
  named <i>bacoti</i>, Tutt. Pairings of <i>bistortata</i> &#x2642; and
  <i>delamerensis</i> &#x2640; produce ab. <i>ridingi-suffusa</i>, Tutt;
  and those of <i>delamerensis</i> &#x2642; and <i>bistortata</i> &#x2640;
  = <i>bacoti-suffusa</i>, Tutt. Further, <i>bacoti-suffusa</i> will pair
  with <i>ridingi-suffusa</i>, or the last named with <i>crepuscularia</i>;
  the progeny being in the first case <i>mixta</i>, Tutt, and in the
  latter, <i>reversa</i>, Tutt.</p>

<h5><b>Brindled White-spot</b> (<i>Tephrosia luridata</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two examples of this species (also known as <i>extersaria</i>, Hübner)
  are depicted on Plate <a href="#plate137">137</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2
  &#x2640;. There is variation in the amount of black speckling and in the
  strength of the cross lines.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is dull hazel or chocolate brown, often tinged with
  green; a row of whitish dots on each side of a series of pale spots along
  the middle of the back; rings 4 and 8 barred with black-brown or dusky
  rust colour. Sometimes the general colour is green. (Adapted from Fenn.)
  It feeds in July and August, or even later, on oak and birch, sometimes
  on alder and sallow. The moth is out in May and June, earlier or later in
  some seasons. In Britain apparently confined to England, where it occurs
  locally, in woods, from Worcestershire <!-- Page 315 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="459.png"><a
  name="page315"></a>{315}</span>southwards to Kent and Cornwall, and
  eastward to Norfolk and Suffolk. In the New Forest, Hampshire, where it
  is often plentiful, it may be seen on the boles of trees, but is more
  easily obtained after dark when it comes to the sugar patch.</p>

<h5><b>Square Spot</b> (<i>Tephrosia consonaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two examples of this species will be found on Plate <a
  href="#plate137">137</a>, Figs. 3 &#x2642;, 4 &#x2640;. There is
  variation in the greyish or brownish speckling of the wings, and this in
  some typical examples is so sparse that the wings appear to be almost
  white with brownish basal band and brownish markings on the outer area;
  the most conspicuous of the latter being the middle square spot between
  the second and submarginal lines, more or less distinct in all forms, to
  which the English name refers. In other specimens the wings are,
  especially the front pair, densely covered with the dark speckling. Some
  Surrey specimens, chiefly from the Leith Hill district, have an ochreous
  tinge; and quite recently a black form of the species has occurred in a
  wood near Maidstone, in West Kent. The last phase of aberration seems to
  be unknown in any other part of Britain, and also, I believe,
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The egg (Plate <a href="#plate138">138</a>, Fig. 2) is yellowish green
  when laid; later it becomes yellow, and orange red markings appear,
  chiefly at one end.</p>

  <p>The somewhat wrinkled caterpillar is ochreous brown above, inclining
  to greyish between the rings; an ochreous line along the middle of the
  back is only clearly defined on the front rings; the under side is
  greenish ochreous, and sometimes this colour extends to the upper side
  also; the head, which is notched on the crown, is pale ochreous, more or
  less marked with brown. It feeds at night, in June and July, on birch,
  beech, oak, pine, etc. <!-- Page 316 --><span class="pagenum" title="460.png"
  ><a name="page316"></a>{316}</span></p>

  <p>The moth is out in May and June, earlier in some districts. In the
  daytime it may be seen on the trunks or boughs of trees, most frequently
  at too great a height to be easily secured; but still a few sit low
  enough for capture, especially on the trunks of fir trees. The species is
  a decidedly local one, and seems to be largely confined, in Britain, to
  the southern parts of England, Wales, and Ireland. It occurs in some of
  the woods of Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire, Dorsetshire, Devonshire,
  Cornwall, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire,
  Essex, and Suffolk. Edwards notes the species as rare at Malvern,
  Worcestershire. Forsythe, in "A List of the Macro-Lepidoptera of
  Lancaster and District" (<i>Entom.</i> 1905, p. 12), states that the moth
  may be found sitting on the fir-tree trunks at the end of May, at
  Witherslack and Quernmore; and a single specimen has been recorded from
  Upton, near Birkenhead, Cheshire. The occurrence of <i>T. consonaria</i>
  in the north of England seems open to question. The only county in Wales
  appears to be Glamorganshire, as mentioned by Barrett. Kane (<i>Catalogue
  of the Lepidoptera of Ireland</i>) noted the species from Derrycunihy,
  and Mucross, Killarney, where he has taken it in moderate abundance; he
  also gives Clonbullogue, in King's County.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Grey Birch</b> (<i>Tephrosia punctularia</i>).</h5>

  <p>Three examples of this greyish species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate137">137</a>. The wings are usually whitish grey in the
  ground colour, and sprinkled or dusted with darker grey; there are three
  blackish, or black dotted, cross lines on the fore wings, often
  indistinct, but rarely entirely absent, and even then represented by
  black marks on the front margin. Sometimes the first and third lines may
  be well in evidence and the central one absent; occasionally the second
  line is placed quite close to the first; the sub-marginal line is
  whitish, inwardly shaded with dark greyish, especially at the middle and
  towards the front margin. The hind wings have two cross lines
  corresponding with the first and third on the fore wings. There is a good
  deal of variation in the amount of dark speckling, and this is
  occasionally so heavy that the insect becomes dark grey in colour; I have
  taken such specimens at Oxshott in Surrey. Dark aberrations are perhaps
  more frequent in the north of England, but the species is more local and
  less plentiful in that part of the country.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which may be beaten from birch, and sometimes alder,
  in July, is bright apple green with yellowish lines on the sides and
  back; the ring divisions are yellow, and the head is tinged with that
  colour. (Adapted from Porritt.) Sometimes the caterpillars are brownish,
  or greenish grey in general colour. The moth, which is out in May and
  June, will be found in woods, or on heaths, where birches grow. It rests
  on the trunks of the trees and may be boxed, as a rule, with ease. On
  some occasions, however, it is very lively, and the net will have to be
  brought into action for its capture.</p>

  <p>The distribution of this species extends through England, but it is
  far more plentiful in the south than in the north, although it has been
  recorded from several places in Yorkshire, and from Coal Law Wood in
  Northumberland. It is found also in Wales, and in Scotland up to Moray.
  In Ireland it is not frequent, but has been noted from Mucross, and the
  Upper Lake of Killarney, in Kerry, and from Tinahely in Wicklow; Kane
  also gives Clonbrock in Galway, and adds that "some specimens from this
  locality have the spots very large on a clear whitish ground, so that
  they have a superficial resemblance to <i>Cleora glabraria</i>."</p>

  <p>The range abroad spreads to East Siberia, Amurland, and Japan.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;Staudinger places the last four
  species in <i>Boarmia</i>, Treitschke; but Prout and others refer them to
  the genus <i>Ectropis</i>, Hübner. The latter will probably have to be
  adopted. <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum" title="464.png"><a
  name="page318"></a>{318}</span></p>

<h5><b>Horse Chestnut</b> (<i>Pachycnema hippocastanaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The rather long and somewhat oval fore wings of this species (Plate <a
  href="#plate137">137</a>, Figs. 8, 9) are brownish grey, inclining to
  purplish grey; the two cross lines are blackish, edged with whitish, but
  generally indistinct; when the lines are well defined, the enclosed
  central area is sometimes darker than the other parts of the wings; there
  is a black central dot, and occasionally there is a well-marked dusky
  central shade. Hind wings, whitish, more or less tinged with smoky grey;
  frequently there is a dusky, curved line beyond the middle, and this is
  sometimes outwardly edged with whitish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greyish brown, dotted with black, and marked on the
  back and sides with reddish brown. When at rest on the twigs of its food
  plant, heather or ling (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>), this caterpillar agrees
  so well with its surroundings that it is not at all easy to see; at
  least, we may see it, but fail to distinguish it from the twigs of the
  plant. It may be obtained in June and July, and again in the autumn.
  (Figured on Plate <a href="#plate140">140</a>, after Hofmann.)</p>

  <p>The first flight of the moth occurs in April and May; the second in
  August, but specimens of the later generation are usually small in size
  and in number, as compared with those of the early brood.</p>

  <p>In Britain, this species has so far only been found on the heaths of
  Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire, Dorsetshire, Somersetshire, Berkshire,
  and Suffolk; in all these counties it is more or less local, but it
  abounds in some of its haunts. It has been recorded from Hereford, and
  Edwards states that it occurs rarely in the Malvern district of
  Worcestershire.</p>

<h5><b>The Annulet</b> (<i>Gnophos</i> (<i>Sciadion</i>) <i>obscurata</i>).</h5>

  <p>In a general way, all the grey specimens of this species are referable
  to the type form <i>obscurata</i>, Schiffermüller; the true type,
  however, appears to be rare in Britain, even if it occurs at all. It is,
  perhaps, best represented by well-marked dark specimens from limestone
  districts, or the lighter ones from peaty ground. At Folkestone and in
  other chalky localities on the Kentish coast, the bulk of the specimens
  are pale grey inclining to whitish, usually with the black cross lines
  showing more or less clearly. Sometimes the lines are obscured by heavy
  freckling (ab. <i>woodiata</i>, Prout); not infrequently, at Folkestone
  chiefly, the inner and outer areas are pale, more or less free of
  freckling, but the central area, defined by black lines, is densely
  freckled; this is the banded form (ab. <i>fasciata</i>, Prout). A form
  occurs on the chalk hills at Lewes in Sussex, in which the wings are
  almost white, without freckling, but with distinct black lines and rings
  (ab. <i>calceata</i>, Staudinger); a modification of this whitish form
  from Lewes has been described by Prout as ab. <i>mundata</i>, "Almost
  pure whitish, with virtually no markings, excepting the annulets." On
  heaths in Surrey and Hampshire, and on the mountains of Aberdeen and
  Perthshire, a blackish form occurs (ab. <i>obscuriorata</i>, Prout =
  <i>obscuraria</i>, Hübner, 146); and sometimes specimens are found in
  which the wings are of "an intense and almost uniform black" (ab.
  <i>saturata</i>, Prout). In Devonshire and Cornwall, the species is
  darkish grey inclining to brownish (ab. <i>anthracinaria</i>, Esper);
  whilst on the coasts of North Devon and Wales it is of a slaty grey, more
  or less tinged with brown, and almost without markings; the Welsh
  specimens are large, and the wings are rather shining (ab.
  <i>uniformata</i>, Prout). A form, which I have not seen, of "a sandy or
  reddish colour" is referred by Prout (<i>Trans. City of Lond. Ent.
  Soc.</i>, 1903, p. 39) to ab. <i>argillacearia</i>, Staudinger; it <!--
  Page 320 --><span class="pagenum" title="468.png"><a
  name="page320"></a>{320}</span>occurs in sandstone localities. (Plate <a
  href="#plate84">84</a>, Figs. 1, Folkestone; 2, New Forest; 3,
  Lewes.)</p>

  <p>The rather rough and dumpy caterpillar is dark greyish brown above,
  inclining to purplish brown beneath; the raised dots are capped with
  white, and there is a pair of white-capped warts on the last ring
  (adapted from Barrett). It feeds on rock rose (<i>Helianthemum</i>),
  cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla</i>), salad burnet (<i>Poterium</i>), etc.; or
  the larvæ may be reared on groundsel, chickweed, and strawberry, both
  wild and cultivated: September to May. (Plate <a
  href="#plate140">140</a>, Fig. 2.)</p>

  <p>Mr. A. J. Scollick kindly gave me some eggs, laid by a female taken in
  Surrey; they were yellowish green at first, but changed to pale brownish.
  The caterpillars hatched and seemed to thrive on groundsel, but they died
  during the winter.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, and is widely distributed in
  England, but except that it occurs in Surrey, Berkshire, Herefordshire,
  and Worcestershire, it seems to prefer the seaboard counties, and in them
  chiefly affects localities near the sea. It is found in Wales, and in
  Scotland up to Moray; but in both these countries and also in Ireland it
  is most frequent on the coast.</p>

<h5><b>Scotch Annulet</b> (<i>Gnophos myrtillata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate139">139</a>, Figs. 4 &#x2642;, 5
  &#x2640;) was introduced, as a species new to Britain, by Curtis, who
  described and figured it as <i>Charissa operaria</i> in 1826, from
  specimens captured in Scotland. Subsequently, it was found to be the
  <i>obfuscaria</i>, of Hübner, and also the <i>obfuscata</i> of the Vienna
  Catalogue (1776). The latter, however, being only a bare name without
  description, was not generally accepted, although, if valid, it would be
  prior to Hübner. Still later the species was ascertained to be the
  <i>myrtillata</i> of Thunberg (1792), and as this name is much earlier
  than <i>obfuscaria</i> it is here adopted. As a matter of fact, both
  names are in use, as that of Hübner applies to our ashy grey form of the
  species, whilst that given by Thunberg belongs to the typical fuscous
  grey form.</p>

  <p>The rather stout caterpillar is grey with darker lines and V-shaped
  marks along the middle of the back, and dark-edged pale lines on the
  sides; two erect whitish points on ring 12. It feeds on heather
  (<i>Calluna</i>), broom (<i>Sarothamnus scoparius</i>), and needle furze
  or petty-whin (<i>Genista anglica</i>), but it may be reared on knot
  grass. September to June, sometimes later.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in July and August, and frequents heaths, moor, and
  mountain, in Scotland from Clydesdale (including Bute and Arran) to
  Aberdeen and Ross, and the Isle of Lewis. A male specimen has been
  recorded from Ireland (Dowros Head, co. Donegal, 1898). It may be found
  resting upon rocks, stone walls, etc.; where these have suitable holes,
  crannies, or projections they are selected as hiding places. Sometimes
  the moth has been noted on the wing during the day, but at night it flies
  freely, and will then visit light.</p>

<h5><b>Black Mountain Moth</b> (<i>Psodos coracina</i>).</h5>

  <p>The smoky-grey species represented on Plate <a
  href="#plate139">139</a>, Figs. 6 &#x2642; 7 &#x2640;, has two black
  lines on the fore wings; these are often edged with whitish, and the
  space between them blackish; the submarginal line is whitish, and the
  discal spot is black; the hind wings have a black central spot and two
  pale lines or bands. The female is rather smaller and much paler. In both
  sexes the central band of the fore wings is generally narrowed below the
  middle, and sometimes it is completely divided at this point.</p>

  <p>As regards the British Isles, this species is known only to occur in
  the Highlands of Scotland. It is a day flyer, and very fond of sunshine,
  but its favourite haunts are situated at elevations of from 2000 to 4000
  feet.</p>

<p><!-- Page 322 --><span class="pagenum" title="472.png"><a name="page322"></a>{322}</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;Newman (<i>British Moths</i>, p.
  68) figures this species as The Dusky Carpet (<i>Mniophila
  cineraria</i>), and the insect, then known by the latter name, is figured
  as <i>Psodos trepidaria</i>, a synonym of the present species. In
  referring to this transposition of names, it may be well to add that
  <i>M. cineraria</i>, catalogued as British by Doubleday, and stated by
  Stainton (<i>Manual</i> ii., p. 31) to have once occurred at Tenby, South
  Wales, can only be regarded as an "accidental." The specimen, which is in
  the Natural History Museum, at South Kensington, appears to be
  <i>Tephronia sepiaria</i>, Hufnagel, which is the <i>cineraria</i> of
  Hübner.</p>

  <p>A moth, supposed to be a specimen of <i>Dasydia tenebraria</i>, Esper
  = <i>torvaria</i>, Hübner, was reported as taken in Ireland "many years"
  before 1843, but at the present time that specimen, apparently, does not
  exist, and there is no exact description of it extant.</p>

<h5><b>Netted Mountain Moth</b> (<i>Fidonia carbonaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The white wings of this species (Plate <a href="#plate141">141</a>,
  Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;) are freckled with blackish and crossed by
  black stripes; sometimes the freckling is so heavy that the white ground
  colour is much obscured and only distinctly seen as edging to the cross
  stripes.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is dingy ochreous or whity brown marked with wavy
  darker stripes. It feeds at night on birch and sallow; <i>Vaccinium</i>,
  <i>Erica</i>, bearberry (<i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>) have also been
  mentioned as food plants.</p>

  <p>In April and May, the moth, which is to be found locally, high up on
  the mountains of Scotland from Perthshire to Ross, is on the wing, and
  flies in the sunshine. Writing of this species at Rannoch in May (about
  17th), 1905, Mr. E. A. Cockayne remarks that the moths began to fly about
  noon, <!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum" title="473.png"><a
  name="page323"></a>{323}</span>when they appeared on all sides and were
  fairly active on the wing.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad is northern and Alpine, and the range extends
  to North-east Siberia.</p>

<h5><b>Frosted Yellow</b> (<i>Fidonia limbaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This black-bordered orange-yellow species (Plate <a
  href="#plate141">141</a>, Fig. 3) is not likely to be confused with any
  other occurring in Britain. The wings are more or less sprinkled with
  black, but this is usually most noticeable on the hind wings which are
  sometimes thickly sprinkled, or, more rarely, the yellow ground colour is
  entirely obscured. The form with a black discal spot on all the wings has
  been named ab. <i>quadripunctaria</i>, Fuchs. In ab. <i>fumata</i>,
  Mathew, the orange yellow is replaced by smoky umber brown, tinged with
  orange, and dusted with black atoms (bred July, 1899).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is greenish with grey-edged yellowish lines along the
  back, and a black-edged yellow one along the sides. The ground colour is
  sometimes purplish brown. It feeds on broom chiefly, but will eat other
  Genisteæ. There appears to be two broods, one in June, and the other in
  September, or earlier sometimes. The moth is out in May and early June,
  and again in July and August, but it has been known to remain in the
  chrysalis for four years. It flies in the sunshine, and when resting, it
  sits like a butterfly, with its wings brought together over its back.</p>

  <p>Stephens (1831) states that the species was "not uncommon among high
  broom in the vicinity of Birch-wood in Kent." Later authors give
  Stowmarket (common), Needham, Barham, and Ipswich, in Suffolk. There are
  no recent records from the county of Kent; and not much has been heard of
  the species from Suffolk, although it may still exist, in greatly reduced
  numbers, in some of its old haunts therein. <!-- Page 324 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="474.png"><a name="page324"></a>{324}</span></p>

<h5><b>Common Heath</b> (<i>Ematurga atomaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Four specimens of this variable species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate141">141</a> (Figs. 4, 5 &#x2642;, 6, 7 &#x2640;). The
  general colour of all the wings in the male is ochreous, inclining to
  whitish or to brownish. Usually the wings are speckled with brown, and
  the cross lines, or bands, are dark brown. Occasionally the cross
  markings are absent; but more frequently the three lines on the fore
  wings are much broadened and more or less united, sometimes forming a
  central band in which are a few ochreous scales towards the front margin:
  ab. <i>obsoletaria</i>, Zetterstedt. Dark brown or blackish specimens
  (ab. <i>unicolorata</i>, Staudinger) are captured now and then in the
  southern counties of England, but such uniform dark varieties are more
  frequent in the north (Staffordshire and Yorkshire). The female is white
  in colour, and usually only lightly speckled with blackish; the cross
  lines are more conspicuous, as a rule, than in the male, but they are
  subject to pretty much the same kind of aberration. Sometimes examples of
  this sex greatly resemble <i>Fidonia carbonaria</i>, and have been
  confused with that species by Haworth and other entomologists in the
  past. An abnormal specimen with six wings has been recorded, and Barrett
  mentions a gynandrous example&mdash;the right side like a small dark
  female, and the left an ordinary male; both antennæ shortly
  pectinated.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, according to Fenn, is variable in colour and
  markings, all shades of brown, greenish brown, ochreous, purple, and
  grey; in some examples there are pale diamonds, and in others whitish
  spots, along the back. It feeds on ling and heath, and will eat clover,
  trefoils, broom, etc.: July and August, and occasionally September. The
  moth is out in May and June, and sometimes there are specimens on the
  wing in August. Abundant on almost every heath throughout the British
  Isles, except in the Shetlands.</p>

<h5><b>Bordered White</b> (<i>Bupalus piniaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two forms of the male of this species are represented on Plate <a
  href="#plate141">141</a>. Fig. 9 shows the yellow English form (ab.
  <i>flavescens</i>, White), and Fig. 10 the white North English and Scotch
  forms. In southern localities, however, specimens occur which are almost
  as white as the northern or even Scotch examples; I have two such
  specimens from Surrey. There is considerable variation in the size of
  area occupied by the pale colour, both in white and yellow forms. In one
  of the former, from Forres, in Scotland, the white is represented by a
  small oval spot and dappled streak on the fore wings; an entirely black
  specimen (ab. <i>nigricarius</i>, Backhaus) has been noted from
  Berkshire. In other specimens there is an unusually large proportion of
  pale colour. The females are usually orange, or orange yellow, in the
  south (Fig. 8); and yellowish brown, or dingy orange brown, in the north.
  The brownish-coloured females occasionally occur in the south, and the
  brighter form of this sex is sometimes taken in the Midlands, where the
  two forms of the species seem to overlap.</p>

  <p>The long, greenish caterpillar is marked with whitish or yellow lines;
  those along the back are edged with black, and along the sides with dark
  green. It feeds from August to October on the needles of the pine, and
  also on other firs. (Plate <a href="#plate140">140</a>, Fig. 3; Fig.
  3<i>a</i> shows a photo of the chrysalis, twice natural size, by Mr. H.
  Main.) The moth is out in May and June, later in the north; it is
  generally common in pine woods throughout England, Wales, and
  Scotland.</p>

<h5><b>Bordered Grey</b> (<i>Selidosema ericetaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>Portraits of the male and female of this species (known also as
  <i>plumaria</i>) will be found on Plate <a href="#plate143">143</a>,
  Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;. The cross markings are more distinct in
  some specimens than in others, and the central one of the fore wings
  varies in width. <!-- Page 326 --><span class="pagenum" title="478.png"
  ><a name="page326"></a>{326}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate142">142</a>, Fig. 3, from a
  photograph by Mr. H. Main) is grey, with a dark-brown or blackish
  irregular double line along the back, and pale lines along the sides, the
  lower one edged above with reddish brown; spiracles, black, as also are
  the dots on the back; the last ring ends in a point. (Adapted from
  Porritt.) It feeds on ling (<i>Calluna</i>), from September well on into
  the following spring.</p>

  <p>The moth occurs on heaths and mosses in July and August, but it is
  local. On warm days the males are very active, but about dusk they are
  not difficult to capture. In southern England, the New Forest, Hants,
  appears to be its special home, but it is also found in other parts of
  that county, including the Isle of Wight, in Dorsetshire, and in Surrey;
  also noted from Berkshire. It is scarce in Cheshire, fairly common on the
  Witherslack mosses in North Lancashire, and at Ullswater in Cumberland.
  Except that it has been recorded from the Isle of Arran (1882), it does
  not seem to have been noted in Scotland. In Ireland it is widely
  distributed, and is abundant at Kinsale, co. Cork.</p>

<h5><b>The V-moth</b> (<i>Thamnonoma</i> (<i>Itame</i>) <i>wauari</i>).</h5>

  <p>The popular name of this species (Plate <a href="#plate143">143</a>,
  Fig. 3) refers to the black discal mark on the more or less violet-tinged
  pale, greyish fore wings; but there is a good deal of variation in this
  character. Occasionally the wings are suffused with smoky (ab.
  <i>vau-nigraria</i>, Hatchett), or more rarely with blackish brown (ab.
  <i>fuscaria</i>, Thunberg).</p>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate142">142</a> is a figure of the caterpillar,
  from a coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich. The general colour is greenish,
  or some shade of brown; the lines on the back are white, and that low
  down along the sides is broad, and yellow; the raised dots are black with
  short bristles. It feeds in April, May, and June on the foliage of
  gooseberry and currant, and is especially fond of the tender shoots. <!--
  Page 327 --><span class="pagenum" title="479.png"><a
  name="page327"></a>{327}</span></p>

  <p>The moth, which is out in July and August, is often common in gardens
  and orchards where bush fruit is grown, pretty well throughout the United
  Kingdom. It appears to occur only rarely in Ireland.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland, and a form is found in
  Labrador.</p>

<h5><b>Rannoch Looper</b> (<i>Thamnonoma brunneata</i>).</h5>

  <p>All the wings are of a rusty ochreous colour, sometimes, chiefly in
  the male, inclining to a purplish tint on the fore wings; the brownish
  cross lines are usually most distinct in the female, which sex Hübner
  figured as <i>pinetaria</i>. (Plate <a href="#plate143">143</a>, Figs. 4
  &#x2642;, 5 &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is reddish brown, with a black-edged dark-green
  irregular line along the middle of the back; a white line on each side of
  the central one, and following this are a dark-brown shade-like stripe
  and some brownish-green lines; the line along the spiracles is whitish,
  inclining to yellow. In general appearance it closely resembles a twig of
  bilberry (<i>Vaccinium</i>), upon the foliage of which plant the
  caterpillar feeds in the spring.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July, but in the British Isles it is only
  to be obtained in Perthshire and northwards in Scotland. Black-wood, Loch
  Rannoch, is the original, and a now well-known, locality for this
  species, which Curtis in 1828 figured as <i>Speranza sylvaria</i>.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland and Japan, and to North
  America.</p>

<h5><b>Brown Silver-line</b> (<i>Lozogramma</i> (<i>Phasiane</i>) <i>petraria</i>).</h5>

  <p>The two cross lines on the pale-brown, sometimes pinkish, fore wings,
  are edged with whitish, but this is most distinct on <!-- Page 328
  --><span class="pagenum" title="480.png"><a
  name="page328"></a>{328}</span>the outer one. In some specimens there is
  a distinct submarginal line, but this character is only faintly in
  evidence as a rule, and occasionally it is entirely absent. (Plate <a
  href="#plate143">143</a>, Fig. 6.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds in June, sometimes earlier, on bracken or
  brake-fern (<i>Pteris aquilina</i>). It is olive green marked with
  reddish brown lines, and there is a whitish line under the black
  spiracles.</p>

  <p>In most English and Welsh localities where bracken is plentiful, this
  moth should be found in May and June; also in the south of Scotland, but
  its occurrence in that country north of Clydesdale appears to be only
  casual. It is common in several parts of Ireland.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad includes Amurland and Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Latticed Heath</b> (<i>Chiasmia</i> (<i>Strenia</i>) <i>clathrata</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its ground colour this species (Plate <a href="#plate143">143</a>,
  Figs. 7, 8 &#x2642;, 9 &#x2640;) varies from ochreous of some shade to
  white. The dark-brown or blackish cross lines and veins give a latticed
  appearance to the wings, hence both the Latin and popular names for this
  insect. There is much variation in the width of the cross markings;
  sometimes two or more unite and so form bands; more rarely, perhaps, the
  outer lines are absent, and the others broken up into dashes; or the
  blackish cross lines may be slender and the veins remain of the ochreous
  ground colour (ab. <i>radiata</i>, Haworth). A less frequent aberration
  has the wings dark brown or blackish all over, except a row of whitish or
  ochreous spots on the outer margins (ab. <i>nocturnata</i>, Fuchs =
  <i>nigricans</i>, Oberthür).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which feeds on clovers and trefoils, is green, with
  white lines along the back and sides; the slightly notched head is rather
  glossy, and the mouth is brownish: June to September, in two broods.</p>

  <p>The first generation of the moth is out in April and May, and <!--
  Page 329 --><span class="pagenum" title="481.png"><a
  name="page329"></a>{329}</span>the second in July and August. It may be
  found in clover fields and on chalk slopes, etc., where the food plants
  flourish; although it is an active day flyer, it is not difficult to
  capture with the net. It is most plentiful in southern and eastern
  England, but its range extends throughout the United Kingdom to
  Clydesdale, and the species is widely distributed in Ireland.</p>

  <p>The distribution abroad extends to East Siberia, Amurland, and
  Japan.</p>

<h5><b>Grey Scalloped Bar</b> (<i>Scodiona fagaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its typical form this species (also known as <i>belgiaria</i>,
  Hübner) is grey, more or less tinged with ochreous, speckled with
  brownish grey, and crossed by black-marked brownish-grey lines. The bulk
  of British specimens, especially those from southern localities, are
  whitish grey, thinly sprinkled with darker grey scales in the male, and
  sometimes heavily powdered in the female; a pair are figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate144">144</a>, 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;. The whiter form of the
  male, occurring in Britain chiefly in the New Forest, Hampshire, has been
  named <i>albidaria</i>, Staudinger.</p>

  <p>The roughened caterpillar is figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate142">142</a> (photo by H. Main). In general colour it is
  dingy brown, with a whitish stripe along the back and some greyish
  marking on the sides. It feeds on ling and heath; growing slowly in the
  late summer, but more quickly in the spring, after hibernation, when it
  may be obtained at night from the tips of the heather twigs, either by
  searching or by means of the sweeping net. The moth is out in June and
  July in the south, and later in the north. It is found on moist heaths,
  moors, and mosses; when resting on the dark-coloured earth it so closely
  resembles a stone that it is probably frequently passed unnoticed.</p>

  <p>The species is apparently more plentiful in the New Forest than in its
  other known southern localities (Kent, Surrey, Berkshire, Sussex, and
  Dorset). Its range northwards in England <!-- Page 330 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="482.png"><a name="page330"></a>{330}</span>extends
  from Worcestershire (Malvern, rare) to Cumberland and Northumberland. It
  seems to be distributed over the greater part of Scotland, including the
  Hebrides and the Orkneys. In Wales it has been recorded from Flint,
  Denbigh, and Carnarvon; and it is widely spread over Ireland, occurring
  chiefly on the bogs.</p>

<h5><b>Black-veined Moth</b> (<i>Scoria lineata</i>).</h5>

  <p>This slightly ochreous tinged silky white moth has the veins of the
  wings blackish, and this is especially noticeable on the underside of the
  fore wings. A male specimen is shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate144">144</a>, Fig. 3; the wings of the female are slightly
  smaller, and the body is stouter and shorter. This species is the
  <i>dealbata</i> of Linnæus, but <i>lineata</i>, Scopoli, is older by four
  years. The long caterpillar is greyish inclining to ochreous or brownish;
  several irregular darker lines on the back and sides. It feeds, in
  confinement, on knot-grass, dock, bird's-foot trefoil, etc., but in the
  open is said to eat wood grasses, such as <i>Brachypodium</i>, upon the
  blades of which the female moth has been seen to deposit eggs: July to
  May. The moth is out from late May through June; it flies in the
  sunshine, or rests among long grass, etc., from which it is readily
  disturbed. Its chief British haunts are in Kent (Higham, Wye, etc.); but
  it has been recorded from Sussex, Dorset, Somerset, Gloucester, and
  Herefordshire, chiefly in single specimens.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Straw Belle</b> (<i>Aspilates gilvaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>This straw-coloured species (Plate <a href="#plate144">144</a>, Fig. 4
  &#x2642;, 6 &#x2640;) will be easily recognised by the brownish stripe on
  the fore wings, which extends from the front margin, near the tip, almost
  to the inner <!-- Page 331 --><span class="pagenum" title="483.png"><a
  name="page331"></a>{331}</span>margin; this is sometimes faint, but
  rarely quite absent. The hind wings are paler and have a dusky central
  dot and incomplete band. The caterpillar, which in shape is somewhat
  similar to that of the next species, is ochreous grey inclining to
  pinkish on the sides; a dark almost blackish line along the middle of the
  back is edged on each side with pale ochreous, and there are other pale
  and dark lines along the sides. It feeds on thyme, cinquefoil, yarrow,
  and other low-growing plants; it may be reared on knot grass: September
  to June. The moth is out in July and August, and, although very local, is
  not uncommon on downs and hilly fields on the chalk in Kent and
  Surrey&mdash;Dover, Folkestone, and Rochester in the former county, and
  Leatherhead, Box Hill, and Reigate in the latter, are the best-known
  localities. It has also been reported from Sussex (Brighton, Horsham,
  near Polgate, Shoreham). In Devonshire it is said to occur at Braunton
  and Ilfracombe, but is scarce. In his catalogue of the Lepidoptera of
  Suffolk (1890) the Rev. E. N. Bloomfield notes the species as very
  plentiful in clover fields about Tuddenham. Also recorded from Somerset,
  Gloucestershire, Cheshire (West Kirby and Hale), and from near Harrow in
  Middlesex.</p>

  <p>Very local and scarce in Ireland (Kane).</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to East Siberia and Amurland.</p>

<h5><b>Yellow Belle</b> (<i>Aspilates ochrearia</i>).</h5>

  <p>As will be seen from Fig. 5 &#x2640; on Plate <a
  href="#plate144">144</a>, this species differs from the last in its
  yellower colour and rather smaller size; the fore wings have two cross
  bands, generally well defined, but in the male they are sometimes very
  faint and slender, and specimens have been recorded in which the bands
  were missing.</p>

  <p>The roughened caterpillar, figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate142">142</a>, from a coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich, is pale
  ochreous brown, lined and striped with darker brown. It feeds on wild
  carrot, plantain, <!-- Page 332 --><span class="pagenum" title="484.png"
  ><a name="page332"></a>{332}</span>hawks'-beard, etc., and will thrive on
  knot-grass. There are two broods, one feeding in the spring, after
  hibernation; and the other in June and July, sometimes later. The first
  generation of moths flies in May and June, and the second in August and
  early September. The species occurs in all the southern seaboard counties
  of England from Kent to Cornwall, frequenting the downs and rough fields
  near the coast; also in the Sandbreck district of the eastern counties.
  It occurs in South Wales; and odd specimens have been reported from
  Cheshire (Delamere), and from Cumberland.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to North-west Africa and Asia Minor.</p>

<h5><b>Grass Wave</b> (<i>Perconia</i> (<i>Aspilates</i>) <i>strigillaria</i>).</h5>

  <p>A male and a female of this species are depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate144">144</a>, Figs. 7 &#x2642; and 8 &#x2640;. There is
  variation in the amount of dark speckling on the wings, and in the number
  and width of the cross markings; sometimes the first and second on the
  fore wings are united throughout their length, or towards the inner
  margin; coupled with this there is sometimes considerable increase in the
  width of the first cross marking of the hind wings. A rare variety in
  Britain is ab. <i>grisearia</i>, Staudinger, which is of an almost
  uniform greyish or greyish-brown colour, with the markings obscured.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is purplish grey, marked with paler and darker; two
  warts on the back of rings 7-10, the middle pair the largest and most
  prominent. It feeds on ling, heath, broom, and the flowers of gorse or
  furze, and is best obtained in the spring after hibernation.</p>

  <p>The moth, which is out in June and July, occurs on most of the heaths
  and moors throughout England; apparently commoner and more generally
  distributed in the south than in the north; but it seems to be rare on
  the eastern side of the country altogether. From Cheshire it spreads into
  Flint and Denbigh, North Wales. In Scotland, it is found in Roxburgh
  (Bellion Moor), Clydesdale (local, but common), and northwards to Ross.
  It is found on the boggy heaths of Ireland, and Kane states that it is
  abundant where it occurs.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Scandinavia and eastward to Asia
  Minor.</p>

<h5 class="lg150">ZYGÆNIDÆ.</h5>

  <p>The moths belonging to this family are popularly known in Britain as
  Burnets and Foresters. Of the former seven kinds occur in the British
  Isles, and of the latter there are only three species.</p>

  <p>All the species live in colonies, so that when a specimen is seen or
  captured others may be expected to occur on, or somewhere around, the
  same spot. The caterpillars bear a close resemblance to each other, and
  are not always easily distinguished.</p>

  <p>Over thirty species of <i>Zygæna</i> are found in Europe, and about
  thirty-six more have been described from other parts of the Palæarctic
  Region. There are at least twenty-five Palæarctic species referred to the
  genus Ino, and about ten of these are European.</p>

  <p>By most authors <i>filipendulæ</i> is regarded as the type of the
  genus <i>Zygæna</i>, Fabricius; but others refer this species, and its
  allies, to the genus <i>Anthrocera</i>, Scopoli, using the Fabrician
  genus for <i>phegea</i>, Linnæus. The latter species and its allies are
  perhaps more frequently referred to <i>Syntomis</i>, Ochsenheimer, the
  typical genus of the family Syntomidæ, the systematic position of which
  is near the Arctiidæ. It may be added that <i>S. phegea</i>, and also
  <i>Naclia ancilla</i>, have been reported as British. There does not
  seem, however, to be any reason to suppose that the occurrence of either
  species in Britain could be other than accidental. <!-- Page 334 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="488.png"><a name="page334"></a>{334}</span></p>

<h5><b>The Transparent Burnet</b> (<i>Zygæna purpuralis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two Welsh specimens are depicted on Plate <a href="#plate146">146</a>,
  Figs. 1 and 2; these are of the typical form. A rare aberration has the
  spots and the hind wings more or less suffused with blackish (ab.
  <i>obscura</i>, Tutt), but a still rarer variety has the crimson of spots
  and hind wings replaced by yellow (ab. <i>lutescens</i>, Tutt).</p>

  <p>Newman in 1861 referred an Irish specimen to <i>achilleæ</i>, but a
  little later, after seeing other examples, in the same year he changed
  the name to <i>nubiginea</i>. Birchall (<i>Ent. Mo. Mag.</i>, iii. pt.
  i.) figured four forms of the species from Ireland; his <i>minos</i>
  (Figs. 5<i>a</i> and 5<i>b</i>) seems to represent two modifications of
  ab. <i>interrupta</i>, Staudinger, in which form the red blotches are
  widely separated or interrupted by the ground colour; and his
  <i>nubigena</i> is made up of more or less typical <i>purpuralis</i>
  (Fig. 6<i>a</i>), and a variety (Fig. 6<i>b</i>), with red marks between
  the lower and central blotches.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate145">145</a>, Fig. 1) is dark
  green inclining to olive above and paler below; the spots are black
  (outer row) and yellow (inner row); the line along the back is obscure
  whitish; hairs, whitish. It feeds on thyme and burnet saxifrage
  (<i>Pimpinella</i>). <i>Trifolium</i> and <i>Lotus</i> have also been
  given among other food plants. In late summer, and after hibernation, in
  the spring. The moth flies in June, and is locally common in Ireland
  (Clare and Galway), Wales (Abersoch), and Scotland (Oban, Loch Etive). It
  has been reported from Tintagel, Cornwall, and possibly, as suggested by
  Tutt, these Cornish specimens may turn out to be <i>Z. achilleæ</i>, the
  latest addition to our small band of Burnets. Perhaps the Scottish
  specimens recorded as <i>purpuralis</i>, or at least some of them, may
  prove to be <i>achilleæ</i>.</p>

  <p>This species was figured by Brünnich, in 1763, as <i>purpuralis</i>,
  and authorities are now agreed that this name must be adopted in place of
  <i>pilosellæ</i>, Esper (1781), or <i>minos</i>, Fuessly (1782). <!--
  Page 335 --><span class="pagenum" title="489.png"><a
  name="page335"></a>{335}</span></p>

<h5><b>Scotch or Mountain Burnet</b> (<i>Zygæna exulans</i>).</h5>

  <p>This semi-transparent and rather greyish moth has five reddish spots
  on the fore wings. (Plate <a href="#plate146">146</a>, Fig. 3.) So far as
  concerns the British Isles it is only known to occur in Aberdeenshire,
  where it was discovered on the mountains at Braemar in July, 1871, and
  where it may be still found by those who are acquainted with the
  situation of its lofty haunts. The late Dr. Buchanan White named the
  Scottish form <i>subochracea</i>, but others consider that it is not
  readily separable from <i>vanadis</i>, Dalman, which in turn is said by
  Tutt to be pretty much the same form of the species as that described as
  the type <i>exulans</i>, Hochenwarth.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is dark green above, and paler below; two velvety
  black stripes on the back, each stripe interrupted by yellow spots; warts
  with black hairs; head, black. It feeds on <i>Silene acaulis</i>, cyphel
  (<i>Arenaria cherleria = Cherleria sedoides</i>), clover, trefoils,
  <i>Azalea procumbens</i>, etc.; has been known to eat dock and
  knot-grass: August to June. The cocoon has been found on a stem of
  crowberry (<i>Empetrum</i>), and on heath and grass stems. The moth is
  out in July, and, like the rest of its kindred, delights in the
  sunshine.</p>

<h5><i>Zygæna achilleæ</i>.</h5>

  <p>A specimen of this species, quite recently introduced as British, has
  been kindly lent by Mr. B. Adkin. It was taken, with others, in the
  vicinity of Oban, Argyllshire. Mr. Sheldon informs me that he believes
  that a worn Zygænid he captured in 1898, in the Glencoe district, was
  this species.</p>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate1">1</a>, with the Scottish example (Fig. 2)
  referred to, is also shown a specimen from the continent (Fig. 3), and it
  will be noted that the former is very like the latter. In some <!-- Page
  336 --><span class="pagenum" title="490.png"><a
  name="page336"></a>{336}</span>respects this species is not unlike some
  confluent-spot forms of <i>filipendulæ</i>, but it is a more
  slender-looking insect, and the body is more hairy. Further, the upper
  basal spot of the fore wings is lengthened almost to the upper spot of
  the middle pair, and the fifth and sixth spots together form an almost
  oval mark. Both specimens depicted seem to be referable to var.
  <i>viciæ</i>, Hübner. In the typical forms the spots are larger. A yellow
  form ab. <i>flava</i>, Oberthür, is known on the continent.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, after Hofmann, is figured on Plate <a
  href="#plate1">1</a>, Fig. 5. It is said to feed on <i>Astragalus</i> and
  <i>Coronilla</i>.</p>

<h5><b>New Forest Burnet</b> (<i>Zygæna meliloti</i>).</h5>

  <p>Two examples of this, normally, five-spotted little species are shown
  on Plate <a href="#plate146">146</a>, Figs. 4 &#x2642;, 5 &#x2640;; a
  variety, referable to ab. <i>confusa</i>, Staudinger (spots run together
  forming streaks somewhat as in <i>purpuralis</i>), is depicted in Plate
  <a href="#plate148">148</a>, Fig. 1. Occasionally a sixth spot is in
  evidence (ab. <i>sexpunctata</i>, Tutt). A form in which the body has a
  red belt is known abroad as ab. <i>stentzii</i>, Freyer, and examples
  having traces of this belt have been recorded from the New Forest, which,
  it may be added, is the only locality in Britain producing this
  species.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is of a dull pale greenish colour, with numerous black
  speckles; three whitish lines on the back, the central one greenish
  tinged and broader than the others, which are interrupted on each ring by
  a yellow spot; between the lines is a series of black dots, one on the
  outer edge of each ring; hairs, from greenish warts, white and short;
  head, black, dotted with white. It feeds on bird's-foot trefoil (<i>Lotus
  corniculatus</i>), and other trefoils and clovers: August to May.
  Sometimes the caterpillars do not complete growth until they have passed
  two winters in hibernation. The cocoon, which is yellow or yellowish
  white, has been found on a grass stem, but <!-- Page 337 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="491.png"><a name="page337"></a>{337}</span>it is
  generally placed so low down among herbage that it seems to be rarely
  detected.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and early July.</p>

  <p>As previously stated the only part of Britain that the species
  inhabits is the New Forest, Hampshire. Here it was first met with in
  Stubby Copse, about 1869, but was apparently not distinguished from <i>Z.
  trifolii</i> until 1872. It is now less frequent in its old haunt than
  formerly, although it still occurs there; in other spots around, I
  believe, it is not uncommon in some years.</p>

  <p>Some authorities refer this species to <i>viciæ</i>, Schranck.</p>

<h5><b>Five-spot Burnet</b> (<i>Zygæna trifolii</i>).</h5>

  <p>Four specimens of this species are portrayed on Plate <a
  href="#plate146">146</a>. In the typical form (Figs. 7 &#x2642;, 8
  &#x2640;) the central pair of crimson spots are united and often form a
  large blotch; ab. <i>orobi</i>, Hübner (Figs. 6 &#x2642;, 9 &#x2640;),
  has the spots placed well apart. Other more or less frequent aberrations
  are depicted by Mr. Horace Knight on Plate <a href="#plate148">148</a>
  where Fig. 2 represents ab. <i>glycirrhizæ</i>, Hübner (spots 3, 4, and 5
  united); Fig. 3, ab. <i>basalis</i>, Selys (spots 3 and 4 united with the
  basal pair); and Fig. 4, ab. <i>minoides</i>, Selys (all the spots
  united, forming an irregular patch). An extreme development of the
  last-mentioned form has been named ab. <i>extrema</i>, Tutt (see
  <i>Entom.</i> xxix., p. 341, Fig. 2). Specimens with a sixth spot as in
  <i>Z. filipendulæ</i> have been occasionally recorded, and an example
  with the lower spot of the central pair absent has been taken in West
  Sussex by Mr. W. M. Christy, who has also obtained a number of specimens
  of a yellow form (ab. <i>lutescens</i>, Cockerell) in the same locality.
  The yellow form is shown on Plate <a href="#plate148">148</a>, Fig. 5.
  Some of the yellow aberrations also exhibit variation in the spots pretty
  much as in the ordinary form. In some localities, especially marshy ones,
  the spots on <!-- Page 338 --><span class="pagenum" title="492.png"><a
  name="page338"></a>{338}</span>the fore wings and the hind wings are
  occasionally dull orange; and I have noted specimens in the Weybridge
  district, Surrey, with the spots on the fore wings of a pinky ochreous
  colour, whilst the hind wings were of the usual crimson. Such
  "aberrations" as those last mentioned probably result from weather
  exposure. In 1899, Mr. G. B. Corbin recorded the capture, near Ringwood,
  Hants, of a specimen which had the spots on the fore wings and the red of
  the hind wings darkened over with dull smoky black, so that the insect
  when seen at a distance seemed to be wholly black. Dr. Hodgson has
  recently obtained several of these melanic specimens in Sussex. A form
  with the spots and hind wings suffused with brownish has been named ab.
  <i>obscura</i>, Oberthür.</p>

  <p>With regard to six-spot examples referred to this species, I am
  inclined to suppose that they may be the offspring of a chance pairing of
  <i>trifolii</i> and <i>filipendulæ</i>. That such crossing does occur in
  nature I have evidence, as on one occasion I found four mixed pairs, the
  male being <i>trifolii</i> in each case, and the female typical
  <i>filipendulæ</i>. This was in the Weybridge district, where I had come
  across a colony of the latter species and was closely examining the
  specimens for aberrations.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate145">145</a>, Fig. 3) is green
  inclining to yellowish and to bluish, with black marks on the back; a
  series of black streaks low down along the sides. It feeds on <i>Lotus
  corniculatus</i>, and on other trefoils and clover: July to May.
  Sometimes taking two years to complete its changes.</p>

  <p>In damp meadows the moth is out in May and June, but in marshes it
  does not appear, as a rule, until July, and may be found in early August.
  The marsh specimens, which are sometimes rather large in size, have been
  referred to <i>palustris</i>, Oberthür, and are treated by Tutt (<i>Nat.
  Hist. Brit. Lep.</i>, vol. i.) as a sub-species.</p>

  <p>In the British Isles, the species is apparently confined to England
  and North Wales. In the former country it is locally common in most of
  the southern counties; still more local in the eastern counties, and
  northwards to Lancashire and Yorkshire. There are records from Armagh and
  Fermanagh, but Kane appears to doubt the occurrence of the species in
  Ireland. There is no doubt that the next species has frequently been
  mistaken for the present one, therefore the actual range of
  <i>trifolii</i> in the British Isles has probably not been fully
  ascertained.</p>

<h5><b>Narrow-bordered Five-spot Burnet</b> (<i>Zygæna loniceræ</i>).</h5>

  <p>As will be seen from the two specimens represented by Figs. 1 &#x2642;
  and 2 &#x2640; on Plate <a href="#plate147">147</a>, this species bears
  considerable resemblance to ab. <i>orobi</i> of <i>Z. trifolii</i>. The
  chief differences are in the rather longer fore wings and the more
  pointed tips of the hind pair; the borders of the hind wings are often
  narrower. In a broad way, it may be stated that the general tone of
  colour in the male of <i>loniceræ</i> is bluer than that of
  <i>trifolii</i>. The union of any two or more spots is rarely seen in
  this species in Britain, but specimens with all the spots joined together
  have certainly been noted. A yellow form, ab. <i>citrina</i>, Speyer (=
  <i>flava</i>, Oberthür), is known on the continent, and Barrett states
  that it has occurred in England. In ab. <i>lutescens</i>, Hewett, the
  hind wings are orange. Ab. <i>eboraceæ</i>, Prest, is semi-transparent,
  steel blue; the spots and the hind wings are pink, the border of the hind
  wings brown, and the fringes of all the wings are whitish.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate145">145</a>, Fig. 2) is very
  similar to that of the last species, but the black marks on the sides are
  heavier, and the hairs of the body are longer. It feeds on trefoils and
  clover, and sometimes passes two winters before becoming full grown. The
  cocoon, which is attached to stems of grass, etc., is generally placed
  well up above the ground, so that it is readily seen. <!-- Page 340
  --><span class="pagenum" title="496.png"><a
  name="page340"></a>{340}</span></p>

  <p>The moth, which is out in late June and in July, occurs in woods and
  plantations; also said to be found in meadows, and on rough waste ground,
  as well as in marshes and salterns. The distribution is much as in the
  last species, but it is plentiful in East Yorkshire, and the range
  extends to Cumberland and Northumberland.</p>

<h5><b>Six-spot Burnet</b> (<i>Zygæna filipendulæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate147">147</a>, Figs. 3-5) is the
  most generally common of our Burnets. Perhaps the most frequent form of
  variation in the spots of the fore wings is that in which the outer pair
  run together, and so form a blotch; but union of the middle pair is not
  an uncommon occurrence. In ab. <i>cytisi</i>, Hübner, the three pairs of
  spots are each united, so that the fore wings have three separate
  blotches, and when these are of a dull scarlet instead of the usual
  crimson, ab. <i>ramburi</i>, Lederer, is represented. Occasionally, all
  the spots are united, as in ab. <i>cytisi</i>, and the blotches thus
  formed are connected by reddish streaks in various modifications leading
  up to ab. <i>conjuncta</i>, Tutt, which has all the spots merged into a
  large blotch, extending over the disc of the fore wings. From the normal
  crimson, the spots and the hind wings vary now and then to orange
  (<i>aurantia</i>, Tutt), or to yellow (ab. <i>flava</i>, Robson =
  <i>cerinus</i>, Robson and Gardner); intermediate shades between these
  two extremes, and the typical coloration, are rather more frequent. I am
  indebted to Mr. R. Adkin for the loan of the example of the yellow form
  shown on Plate <a href="#plate148">148</a>, Fig. 6. Pink, and orange,
  forms have been noted from various parts of England, but they seem to
  occur, or have been found, more especially in Cambridge and the
  north-east corner of Essex. Fig. 7, Plate <a href="#plate148">148</a>,
  represents an example of ab. <i>chrysanthemi</i>, Hübner, and is copied
  from Oberthür's <i>Etudes d'Entom.</i>, xx., Plate <a
  href="#plate8">8</a>, Fig. 134. A few specimens referable to this form,
  probably not exceeding half a dozen altogether, have been recorded as
  taken in England. In typical <i>filipendulæ</i> the dark blue border of
  the hind wings is narrow, but in ab. <i>hippocrepidis</i>, Stephens
  (<i>tutti</i>, Rebel), the borders are rather broad. Another character of
  this form is that the nervule upon which the sixth spot is placed is here
  of the ground colour, and therefore divides the spot. (Plate <a
  href="#plate147">147</a>, Fig. 3.) At Northwood, Middlesex, I have found
  this form in May and June, and also in the Weybridge district, Surrey, in
  late July; and, it may be added, there was a flourishing colony of <i>Z.
  trifolii</i> hard by in each locality. For this reason, plus the fact
  that <i>trifolii</i> &#x2642; is known to pair with <i>filipendulæ</i>
  &#x2640;, I hold the opinion that <i>hippocrepidis</i> is a hybrid. It
  may be noted here that hybrids have been raised from the crossing of
  <i>filipendulæ</i> and <i>loniceræ</i>; the sexes of <i>loniceræ</i> and
  <i>trifolii</i> pair somewhat readily, and the hybrid offspring of such
  pairings are fertile.</p>

  <p>It seems, then, that <i>trifolii</i>, <i>loniceræ</i>, and
  <i>filipendulæ</i> have not, so far, lost the power of fertile
  cross-pairing. Wherever colonies of two of the kind exist within visiting
  distance of each other, there, it appears, we may reasonably expect to
  find hybrids.</p>

  <p>From a number of cocoons collected in a Yorkshire locality for
  <i>loniceræ</i>, I reared, in 1907, a good many examples of that species,
  and also about a dozen six-spot specimens, which agree in colour with
  <i>filipendulæ</i>, but they have the vein-interrupted sixth spot and
  broad border to hind wings, as in <i>hippocrepidis</i>.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate145">145</a>, Fig. 4) is
  greenish, with black markings and some yellow spots, the latter chiefly
  on the hind edges of the rings. It feeds in the autumn and after
  hibernation, on trefoils, clover, bird's-foot (<i>Ornithopus</i>), and
  kidney-vetch (<i>Anthyllis</i>), completing growth in the spring.</p>

  <p>The moth flies on sunny days in July and August, on chalk downs, etc.,
  inland, and on cliffs and sand hills on the coast, also in marshes; but,
  as previously stated, it also occurs locally in meadows in May and June.
  <!-- Page 342 --><span class="pagenum" title="500.png"><a
  name="page342"></a>{342}</span></p>

<h5><b>Scarce Forester</b> (<i>Ino</i> (<i>Rhagades</i>) <i>globulariæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>Of the three species occurring in Britain this is slightly the larger,
  at least in the male. The fore wings are green, sometimes with a slightly
  golden sheen; fringes, greyish. The male is best distinguished from
  <i>statices</i> by its more slender body, and by the pectinated and
  rather pointed antennæ. The female is a good deal smaller than the male;
  the antennæ are simple, and somewhat thread-like, compared with those of
  the females of <i>statices</i> and <i>geryon</i>. (Plate <a
  href="#plate147">147</a>, Figs. 6 &#x2642;, 7 &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is green, with the raised spots inclining to bluish;
  two yellowish-white lines along the back, and a dark green stripe along
  the sides; head and plate on first ring of the body, black. It lives on
  knapweeds (<i>Centaurea nigra</i> and <i>C. scabiosa</i>), feeding on the
  leaves much in the same manner as the caterpillar of the next two
  species.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June and July; it is partial to blossoms of salad
  burnet (<i>Poterium sanguisorba</i>), and only flies in the sunshine. The
  late Mr. J. Jenner Weir, who found the species commonly on the downs near
  Lewes, Sussex, was the first entomologist to record it as British. The
  best known localities in Sussex are Hollingbury Vale and Cliffe Hill, but
  it also occurs at the Devil's Dyke near Brighton. In Kent it is found on
  the downs behind Folkestone and Shorncliffe Camp.</p>

<h5><b>The Forester</b> (<i>Ino</i> (<i>Adscita</i>) <i>statices</i>).</h5>

  <p>In its most frequent form in Britain, this species is bronzy green
  (ab. <i>viridis</i>, Tutt); the typical bluish green type is much less
  frequent. The female is smaller than the male, but the difference in size
  is hardly ever so marked as in the sexes of <i>globulariæ</i>. The
  antennæ of the male are pectinated, but the tips are thickened. (Plate <a
  href="#plate147">147</a>, Figs. 8 &#x2642;, 9 &#x2640;.) <!-- Page 343
  --><span class="pagenum" title="501.png"><a
  name="page343"></a>{343}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate145">145</a>, Fig. 5) is
  whitish, inclining to green, yellow, or pinkish, on the back, and the
  sides are pinkish brown; the hairy warts are brown or pinkish brown, and
  the small head is glossy black. It feeds on sorrel (<i>Rumex
  acetosa</i>), and it attains full growth, after hibernation, about the
  end of April. On leaving the egg-shell in the summer, the young
  caterpillar bores into a leaf, and eats the tissue between the upper and
  lower skins; later on it attacks the foliage from the underside, but
  leaves the upper skin intact; or the process may be reversed, and the
  under skin left.</p>

  <p>The moth is on the wing in June, sometimes late May. It occurs,
  locally, in meadows, frequently damp ones, where there is plenty of
  ragged-robin (<i>Lychnis flos-cuculi</i>), the blossoms of which plant it
  seems to prefer to all others.</p>

  <p>Widely distributed over England, but in Wales only recorded from Capel
  Curig and Barmouth, in the north of that country (1900). In Scotland its
  range extends to Moray; and in Ireland it is found in counties Wicklow,
  Cork, Clare, Westmeath, Monaghan, Sligo, and Galway.</p>

<h5><b>Cistus Forester</b> (<i>Ino</i> (<i>Adscita</i>) <i>geryon</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species is much smaller than the last; the fore wings, the outer
  margins of which are somewhat rounded, are bronze green, but, in the
  male, rather dull in tint, sometimes tinged with golden towards the base.
  The antennae are more stumpy than those of <i>statices</i>, but in other
  respects they are similar in appearance. The female is not much smaller
  than the male. (Plate <a href="#plate147">147</a>, Figs. 10 &#x2642;, 11
  &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish white, with bristle-bearing warts of
  pretty much the same colour; three lines on the back, the central one
  whitish, edged on each side with purplish, the others waved and of a
  claret colour; a reddish-brown stripe low down <!-- Page 344 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="502.png"><a name="page344"></a>{344}</span>along
  the sides; head and plate on first ring of the body black, the latter
  edged in front with yellowish. It feeds on rock rose (<i>Helianthemum
  chamæcistus</i>). At first it attacks the leaf from the upper side, and
  partly burrows therein; when older it clears away patches from the under
  surface, leaving the upper skin of the leaf more or less transparent; as
  it approaches full growth it likes to take its meals in the sunshine, and
  then eats the top skin as well as other parts of the leaf, and also
  tender shoots: July to May. The moth is out in June and July, as a rule,
  but is sometimes observed in May. Its haunts are on warm slopes of chalk
  downs and limestone hills, where it flies in the sunshine.</p>

  <p>This species was first noted as British in March, 1860, when specimens
  from Worcestershire were recorded as <i>Procris tenuicornis</i>. It
  seems, however, to have been considered doubtfully distinct from
  <i>statices</i> until 1863, when the caterpillar was found, and the
  occurrence of the species in several other English counties recorded. At
  the present time <i>I. geryon</i> is known to inhabit Sussex (Brighton
  and Lewes districts), Kent (Canterbury and Shorncliffe), Bucks (Aylesbury
  and Tring), Oxfordshire (Chinor), Gloucestershire (Cotswolds),
  Worcestershire (Malvern Hills), Derbyshire and North Staffordshire
  (Bakewell and Dovedale), Yorkshire (Richmond, Barnsley, Sheffield, etc.),
  and Durham (banks on the coast). In Wales, it is sometimes common on
  Great Orme's Head, Carnarvonshire.</p>

<h5 class="lg150">COCHLIDIDÆ.</h5>

  <p>This family of moths mainly comprises tropical species, and is but
  poorly represented in the Palæarctic Region. Only two species are
  European, and both occur in Britain.</p>

  <p>As <i>Cochlidion</i>, Hübner, supersedes <i>Limacodes</i>, Latrielle,
  the name of the family so long known as Limacodidæ, will have to <!--
  Page 345 --><span class="pagenum" title="503.png"><a
  name="page345"></a>{345}</span>be changed to that here adopted. Meyrick,
  who sinks <i>Limacodes</i> in favour of <i>Apoda</i>, Haworth, uses
  Heterogeneidæ as the family name.</p>

<h5><b>The Festoon</b> (<i>Cochlidion</i> (<i>Heterogenea</i>) <i>limacodes</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of the male are orange brown, more or less smudged or
  clouded with blackish; two oblique black lines, the first inclined
  inwards, and the second outwards and apparently terminating on the outer
  margin just above the inner angle, but there is a slender dusky curve
  from this point enclosing a clear, orange-brown spot. Hind wings
  blackish, except on the inner margin, which is broadly orange brown.
  Female, ochreous brown, with lines on the fore wings as in the male; hind
  wings suffused with dark grey or blackish, except on the inner area;
  generally rather larger than the male. (Plate <a
  href="#plate153">153</a>, Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;.) Not
  infrequently, the fore wings of the male are so much clouded with
  blackish that the cross lines are obscured, and the spot on the inner
  margin alone remains clear.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate149">149</a>, Fig. 1, from a
  coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich) is green, with two reddish-edged yellow
  lines on the back; between these lines are yellowish spots; a yellow line
  along the sides extends along the front edge of the second ring, where it
  is marked with red. It feeds on oak, and may be beaten from the boughs in
  the autumn. The brownish cocoon is depicted on Plate <a
  href="#plate149">149</a>; Fig. 1<i>a</i> shows the hinged lid which
  covered the opening through which the chrysalis protruded previous to the
  moth's escape; Fig. 1<i>b</i> represents one from which the moth has not
  emerged, and in nature this would be attached to a leaf and covered with
  a delicate film of silk. The moth is out in June and July, and both sexes
  may be beaten from the branches of trees, or seen flying around their
  tops in the sunshine. <!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum" title="504.png"
  ><a name="page346"></a>{346}</span></p>

  <p>This species, often referred to as <i>Limacodes testudo</i>, and said
  to be the <i>avellana</i> of Linnæus, is an inhabitant of oak woods, and
  occurs in Hampshire, Sussex, Kent, Essex, Suffolk, Oxfordshire, Bucks,
  Gloucestershire, and Worcestershire. A male and two females have been
  reported from Clonbrock, Co. Galway, Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>The Triangle</b> (<i>Heterogena asella</i>).</h5>

  <p>The fore wings of this little species (Plate <a
  href="#plate153">153</a>, Figs. 4 &#x2642; and 5 &#x2640;) are of
  triangular shape; in the male, which sex is smaller than the female, they
  are dark brown, sometimes almost blackish (ab. <i>nigra</i>, Tutt), and
  those of the female yellowish brown varying to ochreous yellow (ab.
  <i>flavescens</i>, Tutt). The hind wings of the male are blackish, and of
  the female clouded with blackish.</p>

  <p>The curious woodlouse-shaped caterpillar is green, sometimes inclining
  to yellowish; the broad reddish band on the back broadens out before the
  middle, thus giving the idea of a rough cross, or, as sometimes
  described, a blunt spear head. It is found, by searching, in August and
  until October, on the foliage of beech and oak. Birch has also been
  mentioned as a food plant, and on the continent it is said to feed on
  poplar, lime, hazel, and hornbeam. Fig. 2 on Plate <a
  href="#plate149">149</a> is from a photo by Mr. H. Main.</p>

  <p>Although the caterpillar constructs its gall-like cocoon on a leaf or
  in the fork of a twig in the autumn, it does not change to a chrysalis
  until late in spring, sometimes not until June. The moth is out in June
  and July and flies in the sunshine, chiefly in the afternoon, and might
  easily be confused with the Lechean Tortrix (<i>Ptycholoma
  lecheana</i>).</p>

  <p>The species appears to be very local in England and confined to the
  south. Its chief haunts seem to be in Bucks, where it is not uncommon in
  beech woods at Marlow, and in Hampshire, especially parts of the New
  Forest. It has been found in Epping Forest, Essex; rarely in Abbot's Wood
  and Rewell Wood, Sussex; also recorded from Bickleigh Vale and the Plym
  Valley, Devonshire.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to Amurland.</p>

<h5 class="lg150">COSSIDÆ.</h5>

    <p style="text-align:center">(Photo by Hugh Main.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>Of the eighty-six Palæarctic species referred to this family, by far
  the larger number are eastern, only about eight appear to be found in
  Europe, and but three of these occur in Britain.</p>

  <p>Meyrick separates <i>Cossus cossus</i> (<i>ligniperda</i>) from our
  other two species, adopts <i>Trypanus</i>, Rambur, as the generic name,
  and removes it to the Tortricina as a family of that group under the name
  Trypanidæ.</p>

<h5><b>The Goat Moth</b> (<i>Cossus cossus</i> (<i>ligniperda</i>)).</h5>

  <p>The English name of this species (Plate <a href="#plate150">150</a>,
  Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2 &#x2640;) applies more especially to the caterpillar,
  as this creature gives off an odour which has been compared to that of
  the he-goat. In general colour the caterpillar is pinkish ochreous, <!--
  Page 348 --><span class="pagenum" title="508.png"><a
  name="page348"></a>{348}</span>inclining to dark reddish on the back; the
  small head is black and glossy, and the mark on the first ring of the
  body is black. It feeds in the solid wood of various trees, especially
  elm, ash, and willow, but is three or four years in completing growth.
  When mature, it often leaves its burrow and wanders in search of a
  suitable place for pupation. When met with at such times it should be, if
  taken, placed in a roomy tin box with a good supply of sawdust or decayed
  wood, when it will make its cocoon, and appear as a moth in due course.
  The early stages are shown on Plate <a href="#plate151">151</a>.</p>

  <p>Caterpillars are more likely to come under the notice of the country
  rambler than are the moths; examples of the latter, however, may be seen
  occasionally, in June or July, resting on a tree-trunk, a fence, or a
  gate post; sometimes, although practically tongueless, the moth visits
  the sugar patch and either settles on the tree or flutters around.</p>

  <p>The species seems to occur in all parts of the British Isles, except
  perhaps the extreme north of Scotland and the Hebrides.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Amurland and to North-west Africa.</p>

<h5><b>The Leopard Moth</b> (<i>Zeuzera pyrina</i>).</h5>

  <p>As will be seen from the portraits of this blue-black spotted white
  species on Plate <a href="#plate153">153</a>, the male (Fig. 6) is
  smaller than the female (Fig. 7); it will be further noted that the
  antennæ of the male are bi-pectinated on the basal half, and thread-like
  on the outer half; the antennæ of the female are thread-like
  throughout.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate152">152</a>, Fig. 1, from a
  coloured drawing by Mr. A. Sich) is dull whitish, more or less tinged
  with yellow; the spots are black, and the head and plates on the first
  and last rings of the body are blackish brown. It feeds in branches and
  stems of trees and shrubs. Hatching from the egg, say in the late summer
  of 1908, the caterpillar will not be full grown until May or June of
  1910, or possibly 1911; forming a cocoon of silk and wood particles, it
  turns to a reddish brown chrysalis in the burrow, and near the bark of
  the stem or branch. The moth comes out in the summer, and is most often
  seen in the London district, where the female especially is not
  infrequently found on tree-trunks or on grass, etc., under trees. It
  visits light, and the electric arc lamps are very attractive to it.</p>

  <p>The species occurs in the south and east of England, and through the
  north-west counties to Cheshire. It has been recorded from Cardiff, South
  Wales, and doubtfully from Ireland.</p>

  <p>Abroad, the range extends to Corea and Japan. In America it seems to
  be established in parts of the State of New York.</p>

<h5><b>The Reed Leopard</b> (<i>Phragmatæcia castaneæ</i>).</h5>

  <p>A male of this species (<i>Macrogaster arundinis</i> of some authors)
  is shown on Plate <a href="#plate153">153</a>, Fig. 3. The female is
  rather larger, with longer body, and the antennæ are without
  pectinations.</p>

  <p>The wrinkled and rather shining caterpillar is ochreous white with
  reddish-brown stripes along the back. It feeds low down on the stems of
  reed (<i>Phragmites communis</i>) and is full grown in the spring of the
  second year following that in which it left the egg in late summer. Thus,
  a caterpillar hatching in August, 1908, would be mature about May, 1910,
  pupate in that month, or the next, and the perfect insect would appear in
  June or July.</p>

  <p>The moth flies at night, and may be attracted by a brilliant light.
  The earliest known British locality for the species was Holme Fen in
  Huntingdonshire (1841-1848). In 1850 it was found abundantly at
  Whittlesea Mere. Its haunts in the <!-- Page 350 --><span class="pagenum" title="512.png"
  ><a name="page350"></a>{350}</span>present day are Wicken and Chippenham
  fens in Cambridgeshire, but specimens from these localities are somewhat
  smaller than the old Hunts examples. Barrett states that he put down some
  eggs of the species in Ranworth Fen, Norfolk, and that five years later
  two males were captured within a short distance of the spot where the
  eggs had been placed.</p>

  <p>The range abroad extends to China and Japan.</p>

<h5 class="lg150">SESIIDÆ.</h5>

  <p>This family&mdash;the Ægeriadæ of some authors&mdash;has over one
  hundred Palæarctic species assigned to it; these are distributed among
  five genera, two of which are not represented in Britain. Fourteen
  species are found in the British Isles, but to obtain fine specimens of
  most of them the mature caterpillars or the chrysalids will have to be
  collected and the moths reared. All species emerge from the chrysalis
  early in the forenoon, and then only under the influence of sunshine.</p>

  <p>The caterpillars are somewhat maggot-like, and live in stems,
  branches, and roots of trees and shrubs; or in the crowns and roots of
  low-growing plants. The majority, possibly all, are nearly two years in
  arriving at full growth.</p>

<h5><b>Hornet Moth</b> (<i>Trochilium apiformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>As indicated by the English name this moth, and also that next to be
  mentioned, are very like the hornet (<i>Vespa crabro</i>). On turning to
  Plate <a href="#plate154">154</a>, Fig. 1, it will be seen that this
  species has a yellow head and patches of yellow on the shoulders; these
  characters at once separate it from <i>T. crabroniformis</i>.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish white, with a red brown head, and a
  yellow plate on the first ring of the body. It feeds on the roots and
  lower portion of the trunks of poplar. The brown shining chrysalis is
  enclosed in a cocoon of wood scrapings woven together with silk. The moth
  is out in May and June; and has been found, newly emerged, sitting on
  stems of poplar in the morning.</p>

  <p>The eastern counties of England appear to be most favoured by this
  species, but it also occurs northwards to Yorkshire, southwards to
  Devonshire, and a specimen has been recorded from Rhyl, North Wales. In
  Scotland, it has been reported from some localities in the south; Kane
  states that he has reason to believe that the species occurs in the
  northern half of Ireland, and that he found caterpillars plentiful in
  young poplars growing in a marsh near the city of Waterford.</p>

<h5><b>Lunar Hornet</b> (<i>Trochilium crabroniformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Another hornet-like moth, best distinguished from that just mentioned
  by the yellow collar behind the black head (Plate <a
  href="#plate154">154</a>, Fig. 7 &#x2640;). The male is rather smaller,
  but otherwise similar.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is yellowish white, with dark brownish head, and a
  blackish edged yellow plate on the first ring of the body. It feeds in
  stems of sallow, willow, and poplar. In late June and through July the
  moth is on the wing, and may occasionally be seen at rest on leaves or
  stems of sallow, etc.</p>

  <p>The species, known also as <i>bembeciformis</i>, Hübner, is generally
  distributed throughout England, Wales, and Ireland; in Scotland its range
  extends into Perthshire.</p>

  <p>Abroad it seems pretty much confined to Holland, Northern and Central
  Germany, Austria, and Bohemia.</p>

<h5><b>Clear Underwing</b> (<i>Sciapteron tabaniformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species is the <i>Trochelium vespiforme</i> of some British
  authors, and the <i>Ægeria asiliformis</i> of Stephens and others.</p>

  <p>Another English name for it is the Dusky Clearwing, and this refers to
  the cloudy fore wings. <!-- Page 352 --><span class="pagenum" title="516.png"
  ><a name="page352"></a>{352}</span></p>

  <p>Stephens, writing of it in 1828, remarks: "Occasionally taken on
  poplars, near London, in June. I have obtained it from the neighbourhood
  of Bexley, and from Birchwood; but it is doubtless a rare species, and
  exists in few collections: of the male, I have hitherto seen but two
  specimens, one of which I possess." Both places mentioned by Stephens are
  in Kent, and one or two specimens of the species have since been reported
  from Ashford in the same county. The late Henry Doubleday took specimens
  at Epping, Essex. Colney Hatch Wood in Middlesex has also been given as a
  locality in the past; more recently two specimens have been noted from
  Chiswick. The example shown on Plate <a href="#plate154">154</a>, Fig. 4,
  is of continental origin.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar lives under the bark of poplar trunks, and the moth
  flies in June and July.</p>

<h5><b>Welsh Clearwing</b> (<i>Sesia scoliæformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>As a British species this insect was first noted from Llangollen, in
  North Wales, somewhere about fifty years ago. In 1867 it was found to
  inhabit birch woods in the Rannoch district of Scotland, and later on its
  presence was detected in Sutherlandshire. It has been recorded from
  Hereford; one example was reported from Wiltshire in 1857; and two from
  Delamere Forest, Cheshire (1901 and 1905). Kane (<i>Catalogue of the
  Lepidoptera of Ireland</i>) states that moths have been taken at
  Killarney, and caterpillars obtained in the same district, and also at
  Kenmare.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate156">156</a>, Fig. 3; after
  Hofmann) feeds on the inner layer of bark of large birch trees, and is
  full grown about May. It turns to a dark brownish chrysalis, in a cocoon
  formed close up to the bark, which thinly covers the outer end of the
  burrow. The moth flies in June or sometimes July. It <!-- Page 353
  --><span class="pagenum" title="517.png"><a
  name="page353"></a>{353}</span>is of comparatively large size, and may be
  distinguished from the next species by the yellow belts on its body, and
  the chestnut coloured tuft at the tail. (Plate <a
  href="#plate154">154</a>, Fig. 2.)</p>

<h5><b>White-barred Clearwing</b> (<i>Sesia spheciformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Although generally smaller, some specimens run very close to the last
  species in size. It may be distinguished by the single belt on the body
  and the black tail (Plate <a href="#plate154">154</a>, Fig. 3). One of
  the best known localities for the species in England is Tilgate Forest,
  in Sussex; but it also occurs in Hampshire (Basingstoke), Hereford
  (Tarrington), Worcestershire (Wyre Forest), Staffordshire (Burnt Wood),
  Cheshire (one, Delamere Forest, 1901), Denbighshire (Llangollen),
  Lancashire (Chat Moss), and Yorkshire (Bishop's Wood, 1894).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds in stems of alder, and is full grown in May of
  the third year after hatching from the egg. It is said that the chrysalis
  may sometimes be found by bending and twisting the stems of alder, so as
  to cause the thin skin of bark over the exit hole of the burrow to crack,
  and so disclose its whereabouts. The burrow is generally low down the
  stem. The moth is out in June and early July, and is sometimes to be seen
  on sunny mornings at rest on alder leaves, or flying over and around the
  bushes.</p>

<h5><b>Orange-tailed Clearwing</b> (<i>Sesia andrenæformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>Although known to be a British species since 1829, when a specimen was
  taken in a wood near Greenhithe, Kent, this insect continued to be very
  rare until quite recently. For a long time the caterpillar was supposed
  to feed in the stems of dogwood, but it is now known to live in the stems
  of the wayfaring tree (<i>Viburnum lantana</i>), and several specimens of
  the moth <!-- Page 354 --><span class="pagenum" title="518.png"><a
  name="page354"></a>{354}</span>have been reared during the past year or
  two. Unfortunately the caterpillar is much infested by parasites, and
  comparatively few escape attack. Notes on the life history of this moth,
  by the Hon. N. Charles Rothschild, Mr. Eustace Bankes, and Dr. Chapman,
  are published in the <i>Transactions of the Entomological Society of
  London</i> for 1906 (Part IV., pp. 471-482).</p>

  <p>Most of the known localities for the species are in Kent, but it has
  also been found in Surrey, Dorset, Gloucester, Hertfordshire (Tring
  district), and Northamptonshire (Oundle). Possibly it will be discovered
  in other parts of the country. I am indebted to Mr. L. W. Newman, of
  Bexley, for the specimen figured on Plate <a href="#plate1">1</a>, Fig.
  1. For the caterpillar mine in stem of <i>Viburnum</i> (Plate <a
  href="#plate156">156</a>, Figs. 2, 2<i>a</i>) my thanks are due to Mr.
  Rayward, who kindly sent me a living pupa, from which the moth duly
  emerged, but, I regret to add, escaped from the box in which the stick
  containing the chrysalis was kept.</p>

  <p>Newman, in 1833, described this species as <i>Trochilium
  allantiformis</i>, and in 1842 it was figured by Westwood and Humphreys
  as <i>T. andreniforme</i>. It is distinguished from <i>Sesia
  tipuliformis</i> by the two yellow belts of the body (the first sometimes
  indistinct) and the orange-yellow tuft in the blue-black tail; on the
  underside of the body there is a broad yellow band on the fourth ring,
  sometimes extending to the fifth and sixth.</p>

<h5><b>Currant Clearwing</b> (<i>Sesia tipuliformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>In this species the body is narrowly belted with yellow, usually four
  belts in the male and three in the female; the tail tuft is black in both
  sexes. The outer marginal border of the fore wings has a bronzy tinge,
  due to orange patches between the veins. (Plate <a
  href="#plate154">154</a>, Figs. 5 &#x2642;, 6 &#x2640;.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar lives in the stems and shoots of black and red currant
  bushes; it feeds on the pith, and works its way downwards. When full
  grown, about May, it gnaws an outlet to the <!-- Page 355 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="519.png"><a name="page355"></a>{355}</span>side of
  the stem, but does not penetrate the outer skin, although it reduces this
  to a very thin layer, through which the reddish brown chrysalis is able
  to force itself when the moth is ready to emerge. A figure of the
  caterpillar will be found on Plate <a href="#plate156">156</a>, Fig. 1;
  the chrysalis protruding from currant stem (Fig. 1<i>a</i>) is from a
  photo by Mr. H. Main. In June or July, the moths are not infrequently
  seen on leaves of shrubs in gardens where there are currant bushes in or
  around such gardens, but the foliage of the food plant is a favourite
  resting place.</p>

  <p>Generally distributed throughout England, the range extending into
  Wales, and South Scotland, but is apparently rare in these countries and
  also in some of the northern counties of England. Kane states that the
  species is common near Dublin, and is probably widely distributed in
  Ireland.</p>

  <p>This species seems to have been introduced into North America, where
  its caterpillar is known as the "currant borer," and, as in England, is
  regarded with little favour by bush-fruit growers.</p>

<h5><b>Yellow-legged Clearwing</b> (<i>Sesia vespiformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate155">155</a>, Fig. 1), known also
  as <i>asiliformis</i>, Rottemburg (1775), and <i>cynipiformis</i>, Esper
  (1782), is now held to be correctly referred to <i>vespiformis</i>,
  Linnæus (1761). The crossbar of the fore wings is orange red in both
  sexes; the body of the male has two more or less united yellow spots at
  the junction with the thorax, four yellow belts, and the tail tuft is
  black above, mixed with yellow below; in the female the body belts are
  usually one less than in the male, the yellow spots at the junction are
  generally run together, and the tail tuft is almost wholly yellow. As
  indicated by the English name, the legs are largely yellow in both
  sexes.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds on the inner bark of oak trees, is full <!--
  Page 356 --><span class="pagenum" title="520.png"><a
  name="page356"></a>{356}</span>grown in May or June, and turns to a
  brownish chrysalis in a cell formed in the bark. A well-known locality
  for this moth, which is out in July and early August, is Hyde Park,
  London. It is also found in woods or oak-timbered parks in Kent
  (Tunbridge Wells), Surrey, Sussex (Abbot's Wood, Tilgate, etc.), Dorset
  (Glanvilles Wootton, etc.), Devon (Devonport, Plymouth, Topsham, etc.),
  Essex (Epping), Suffolk, Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Leicestershire,
  Staffordshire, and Yorkshire (Doncaster).</p>

<h5><b>Red-belted Clearwing</b> (<i>Sesia myopæformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>One example of each sex is shown on Plate <a href="#plate155">155</a>,
  where Fig. 2 represents the male and Fig. 3 the female; both have a
  single belt on the body; as a rule, the belt is red, but occasionally it
  inclines to orange or yellow.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds on the inner bark of the trunks or boughs of
  apple, and sometimes pear, trees. It is nearly two years in maturing, but
  is full grown about June. The moth is out during the summer months, and
  is to be seen early on sunny mornings, newly emerged from the chrysalis
  on the trunks of the trees in which the caterpillar lives; the chrysalis
  skins will also be noted at the same time, sticking out from holes in the
  bark. Later in the day it sits on leaves, etc., after its flights, and I
  have even found it occasionally on a gravel path, and once on the
  pavement of a road in North-west London.</p>

  <p>The species seems to be most frequent in gardens and orchards around
  London, but it has been recorded from as far north as Lancashire and
  Yorkshire; it is probably widely distributed over England. The Irish
  localities, mentioned by Kane, are Dublin, Cork, Killarney, and
  Clonbrock.</p>

<h5><b>Large Red-belted Clearwing</b> (<i>Sesia culiciformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This species (Plate <a href="#plate155">155</a>, Fig. 4) is very
  similar to the last, but it is larger, and the fore wings are dusted with
  reddish scales towards the base, sometimes also along the inner margin.
  The belt on the body is generally red, not infrequently with an orange
  tinge, but it is sometimes yellow or far more rarely white.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, which is full grown in May, feeds on the inner bark
  of birch trees and bushes, apparently preferring the stumps left in the
  ground where stems have been cut down. It is not difficult to find, but
  as it is about two years in this stage it should not be taken until
  nearly or quite full grown, and it is safer to leave it until it has
  entered the chrysalis state. The moth is out in June, or sometimes at the
  end of May; it flies over birch and rests on leaves, and has been known
  to visit flowers of the wood spurge and the rhododendron.</p>

  <p>Kent and Sussex appear to be the counties most favoured by this
  species, but it occurs in most of the other English counties in which
  there are birch woods, certainly up to Yorkshire, and probably further
  north, as it is found in Scotland (Clydesdale, Perthshire, and Aberdeen).
  The Irish localities are Killarney, Ballinasloe, and Derry.</p>

<h5><b>Red-tipped Clearwing</b> (<i>Sesia formicæformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is another red-belted species, but it differs from either of the
  two immediately preceding in having the fore wings tipped with red.
  (Plate <a href="#plate155">155</a>, Fig. 5.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds in the twigs and stumps of osier (<i>Salix
  viminalis</i>), sometimes called "withe"; it is full grown about June.
  (Plate <a href="#plate156">156</a>, Fig. 2; after Hofmann.) The moth is
  out in July and August; it is partial to marshes and other wet spots,
  <!-- Page 358 --><span class="pagenum" title="524.png"><a
  name="page358"></a>{358}</span>and is fond of a leaf as a resting place.
  Like the rest of its kind, it is very alert, and skips off quickly on
  one's approach. Probably the species is more widely distributed in
  England, but from the records, it only appears to have been noted from
  Kent, Hampshire, Somersetshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire,
  Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, and Essex.</p>

<h5><b>Six-belted Clearwing</b> (<i>Sesia ichneumoniformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The inner and outer margins of the fore wings are tinged with orange,
  and there is an orange mark on the outer edge of the cross bar; the body
  of the male has seven yellow belts, and that of the female one less.
  (Plate <a href="#plate155">155</a>, Fig. 6.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds in the roots of bird's-foot trefoil (<i>Lotus
  corniculatus</i>), and kidney vetch (<i>Anthyllis vulneraria</i>); it is
  full grown about June. July and August are the months for the moth, and
  its haunts are on chalk downs, and on banks by the sea; it seems partial
  to the edges of chalk pits, sloping banks, and broken ground of
  undercliffs, etc. In such places it is to be seen on the wing in the
  early evening, and, I believe, in the early morning also. It has
  frequently been obtained by sweeping the net over herbage in the vicinity
  of the food plants.</p>

  <p>Mr. W. H. Flint records (1902) the species from the Forest of Dean
  district, where, he states, he could easily have captured two dozen a
  day, as they flew over trefoils, etc.</p>

  <p>The species occurs in most of the southern seaboard counties of
  England, from Kent to Cornwall and including the Isle of Wight; Surrey,
  Bucks., Essex, and other eastern counties, including Cambridge; and it
  has been recorded from Yorkshire. On the western side of the country it
  is found in Somerset, Gloucester, Hereford, Worcester, Staffordshire, and
  in South Wales. <!-- Page 359 --><span class="pagenum" title="525.png"><a
  name="page359"></a>{359}</span></p>

<h5><b>Thrift Clearwing</b> (<i>Sesia muscæformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>This is our smallest species of the genus, and it is further
  distinguished by narrow clear spaces on the blackish, or bronzy, fore
  wings, three whitish bands on the body, and traces of a whitish line
  along the middle of the back. (Plate <a href="#plate155">155</a>, Fig.
  7.)</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds on the roots of thrift or sea-pink (<i>Armeria
  vulgaris</i>), and is full grown about June. The moth is out in June and
  July, and seems to have a liking for the flowers of thyme.</p>

  <p>This species (also known as <i>philanthiformis</i>, Laspeyres)
  frequents rocky places on the coasts of Devon (Torquay, Lynmouth, etc.),
  Cornwall, Wales; Isle of Man; Scotland (Aberdeenshire); and Ireland
  (Saltee Islands, Wexford, and Seven Heads, Cork. Gregson recorded it from
  Howth).</p>

<h5><b>Fiery Clearwing</b> (<i>Sesia chrysidiformis</i>).</h5>

  <p>The orange red colour on the fore wings, and of the tail tuft, at once
  distinguish this species (Plate <a href="#plate155">155</a>, Figs. 8
  &#x2642;, 9 &#x2640;) from either of its British allies. The blackish
  body has two pale-yellow belts, but in the male the lower one is often
  double. As a rule, the body of the female is stouter than that of the
  male, but the bodies of some males appear quite as thick as those of the
  females, and the true sex is only disclosed by the ciliated antennæ,
  which is a character of the male alone.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds on the roots of dock and sorrel, and it is full
  grown about May. In June and July the moth is on the wing and flies in
  the sunshine, about noon, over the food plants.</p>

  <p>The species occurs not uncommonly in the Warren at Folkestone, Kent.
  This locality, well known to entomologists, is a long stretch of rough
  broken ground lying between the railway <!-- Page 360 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="526.png"><a name="page360"></a>{360}</span>and the
  sea; and is probably the only spot in the British Isles where the Fiery
  Clearwing is almost certain to be found, either in its early or its
  perfect stage, at the proper season. The moth has been recorded from
  Eastbourne, Sussex (1874), and from the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire
  (1902).</p>

<h5 class="lg150"><b>HEPIALIDÆ.</b></h5>

  <p>Of the twenty-two Palæarctic species belonging to this family, nine
  appear to occur in Europe, and the range of five of these extends to the
  British Isles.</p>

  <p>In some of the more recent systems of classification, this family is
  relegated to almost the bottom of the scheme, and therefore occupies a
  much lower place than do the bulk of the families comprised in the old
  style "Micro-Lepidoptera." As, however, these insects, commonly called
  "Swifts," have long received the attention of collectors, and in
  collections usually occupy a position among the so-called "Bombyces,"
  they have been included in the present volume.</p>

<h5><b>Ghost Moth</b> (<i>Hepialus humuli</i>).</h5>

  <p>On Plate <a href="#plate157">157</a> are portraits of a male and a
  female of the typical form of this species (Figs. 1 &#x2642; and 3
  &#x2640;); and two male examples (Figs. 2 and 4) of the Shetland race
  var. <i>thulensis</i>, Newman, better known perhaps as
  <i>hethlandica</i>, Staudinger, but the former is the older name. It will
  be noted that in the ordinary form the male has white wings, and that the
  female has yellowish fore wings marked with orange, and smoky hind wings.
  The Shetland male, represented by Fig. 2, has the fore wings whitish buff
  in colour with brownish markings similar in pattern to those of an
  ordinary female; the hind wings are blackish. The second example of
  <i>thulensis</i> (Fig. 4) is somewhat similar in appearance to a typical
  female. In other male specimens of this insular race the wings are pretty
  much of the typical colour, but the markings on the front pair are
  reduced both in number and size. Mr. H. McArthur, who has collected a
  good deal in the Shetland Isles, states that in Unst, the most northern
  island of the group, more or less typical <i>humuli</i> were found on the
  cliffs facing south-east, whilst the majority of the specimens obtained
  in boggy meadows, etc., were of the <i>thulensis</i> form.</p>

<p><!-- Page 361 --><span class="pagenum" title="529.png"><a name="page361"></a>{361}</span></p>

  <p>The caterpillar feeds on the roots of plants, such as burdock,
  dandelion, dead-nettle, etc. It is full grown in May, and the moth is out
  in June and July. (Plate <a href="#plate159">159</a>, Fig. 2; after
  Hofmann.) The males may be seen in the evening, sometimes in numbers in
  grassy places, swaying themselves to and fro without making progress, and
  appearing as though they dangled from the end of an invisible thread; the
  female flies straight, and, as a rule, in the direction of one or other
  of the pendulous males.</p>

  <p>The species is generally distributed over the British Isles.</p>

<h5><b>Orange Swift</b> (<i>Hepialus sylvina</i>).</h5>

  <p>The male of this species (Plate <a href="#plate157">157</a>, Figs. 5.
  &#x2642;, 6 &#x2640;) usually some shade of orange brown, with
  greyish-edged white markings on the fore wings. Sometimes the female is
  orange brown, but more often it is some shade of grey brown.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar (Plate <a href="#plate159">159</a>, Fig. 3; after
  Hofmann) feeds on the roots of dock, bracken, viper's bugloss, etc., and
  is full grown about July. In late July and in August the moth may be seen
  in the early evening flying among bracken, and not infrequently around
  trees fairly high up. Occasionally, specimens are seen in the daytime on
  tree-trunks, fences, etc. At one time this species was known in the
  vernacular as "The Tawny and Brown Swift"; it is also "The Orange or
  Evening Swift" of Harris (1778) and the "Wood Swift" of Newman. It is
  <!-- Page 362 --><span class="pagenum" title="530.png"><a
  name="page362"></a>{362}</span>common in many southern and eastern parts,
  but widely distributed over England, Wales, and Scotland to Moray. Only
  doubtfully recorded from Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Map-winged Swift</b> (<i>Hepialus fusconebulosa</i>).</h5>

  <p>At one time this species (the <i>velleda</i> of Hübner) was known as
  the "Northern Swift," but as it is plentiful in North Devonshire and
  Somersetshire, and occurs less commonly in other southern English
  counties, that name is hardly suitable. Haworth's English name for
  it&mdash;"The Beautiful Swift"&mdash;does not quite meet the case,
  because, although the insect is prettily marked, it is scarcely
  beautiful. We have then to fall back on Donovan's Map-winged Swift as a
  popular name, and this seems a fairly apt one, as the markings on the
  fore wings are somewhat map-like in pattern, especially in the more
  typical specimens.</p>

  <p>There is much variation in colour and in marking; some examples,
  chiefly those from Shetland, are prettily variegated. A uniform
  reddish-brown variety, ab. <i>gallicus</i>, Lederer, is depicted on Plate
  <a href="#plate158">158</a>, Fig. 3; and a more or less typical specimen
  of each sex is shown on the same plate (Figs. 1 &#x2642;, 2
  &#x2640;).</p>

  <p>The caterpillar is ochreous white, with orange-brown plates, and
  rather paler raised dots; head, reddish brown, and spiracles black. It
  feeds on the roots of the bracken, and is full grown about May. The moth
  is out in June and July, and flies, in the gloaming, on hill slopes,
  heaths, and the edges of mosses and woods; it seems to be more active
  than either of the other British "Swifts"; at all events, I have always
  found it less easy to capture with the net.</p>

  <p>The species is pretty generally distributed throughout the British
  Isles. <!-- Page 363 --><span class="pagenum" title="531.png"><a
  name="page363"></a>{363}</span></p>

<h5><b>Common Swift</b> (<i>Hepialus lupulina</i>).</h5>

  <p>Three examples of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate158">158</a>. Fig. 4 is a typical male, Fig. 5 a whitish
  suffused variety, and Fig. 6 is a female. The latter sex is generally
  devoid of marking, and in the male the stripes and dashes are far more
  conspicuous in some specimens than in others.</p>

  <p>The glossy whitish caterpillar has a brown head; the plate on the
  first ring of the body is brownish, and the raised dots are pretty much
  of the same colour. It feeds on the roots of grass and other plants, and
  is full grown about April. A figure of the caterpillar, from a drawing in
  colour by Mr. A. Sich, and a photo of the pupa by Mr. H. Main, are shown
  on Plate <a href="#plate159">159</a>, Figs. 1 and 1<i>a</i>; the latter
  is twice natural size.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June, or sometimes late May, and occasional
  specimens have been noted in September. It is more frequently seen at
  rest, on fences, etc., than either of the other species of the genus; but
  towards dusk it is on the wing, and may then be observed in large numbers
  careering over grass meadows or along stretches of green turf by the
  wayside.</p>

  <p>Generally distributed, and often abundant, throughout the United
  Kingdom; and it occurs in Monaghan, Mayo, Galway, and Kerry, in
  Ireland.</p>

<h5><b>Gold Swift</b> (<i>Hepialus hecta</i>).</h5>

  <p>Both sexes of this species are shown on Plate <a
  href="#plate158">158</a>, where Fig. 7 represents the golden-marked male,
  and Fig. 8 the more dingy, dull, purplish-grey striped female. There is
  variation in number and in size of the markings on the fore wings of the
  male, and occasionally the hind wings in this sex are adorned with golden
  spangles on the outer area.</p>

  <p>The pale greyish brown caterpillar has glossy darker brown <!-- Page
  364 --><span class="pagenum" title="532.png"><a
  name="page364"></a>{364}</span>plates on rings 1-3, and the raised dots
  and the spiracles are black. It feeds on the roots of bracken, and is
  full grown about May. Buckler states that at first it burrows in the
  root, hibernates when small, resumes feeding in April, attains full
  growth before winter, and hibernates in the earth for a second time; in
  the spring of the second year it gnaws cavities in the young shoots of
  the bracken, and apparently drinks the flowing sap.</p>

  <p>The moth is out in June. The males fly at dusk, something in the
  manner of <i>humuli</i>, over and among the bracken; but the females fly
  in a more or less direct line. An odour given off by the males of this
  species has been likened to that of the pine apple; whilst the "scent" of
  the Ghost Moth is said to be more of the billy-goat character.</p>

  <p>In most woody localities, where the bracken flourishes, this species
  will be found throughout England, Wales, Scotland to Aberdeen and the
  Hebrides, and Ireland.</p>
